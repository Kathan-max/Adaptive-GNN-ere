Leveraging data from the 2021 National Financial Capability Study, we find a significant and positive average treatment effect of financial literacy education on financial health. To test the robustness of this ef- fect, we utilize a variety of causal estimators (Gen- eralized Lin\u2019s estimator, 1:1 propensity matching, IPW, and AIPW) and conduct sensitivity analysis using alternate health outcome scoring and vary- ing caliper strengths. Our results are robust to these changes. The robust positive effect of finan- cial literacy education on financial health found here motivates financial"

Can financial literacy education then help people make sounder financial decisions? Many seem to think so. There are consistent calls for greater financial education for Americans (Wash- ington Post Editorial Board, June 2022) (Kasman et al., 2018) (Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, 2023) and a number of states have enacted financial educa- tion requirements for high school students.

The Hajek estimator was calculated using the PSweight pack- age (Zhou et al., 2022), and the Horvitz-Thompson estimator was implemented directly using base R functions. 4.4. AIPW A potential issue with using IPW based estimators is that they have high variance. This motivates the Augmented In- verse Propensity Score Weighted estimator (AIPW), whichapplies the idea of inverse propensity weighting to a general function gof the covariates X. Directly applying such a function in the IPW introduces bias into the estimator, but this bias term can be computationally corrected for, result- ing in an overall unbiased estimator. To show this, we can observe that for any function g(X), the following is true: E\" 1 nnX i=1Zig(Xi) e(Xi)\u22121 nnX i=1g(Xi)# =1 nnX i=1\u0012 E\u0014Zig(Xi) e(Xi)\u0015 \u2212E[g(Xi)]\u0013 =1 nnX i=1\u0012 E\u0014E[Zi|Xi]g(Xi) e(Xi)\u0015 \u2212E[g(Xi)]\u0013"

Discussion 8.1.Effect of Financial Literacy Education on Financial Health All estimation methods in Table 1 provide strong statisti- cal evidence to indicate that financial education positively impacts financial health. All of these results were signifi- cant at the 5% confidence level. As expected, the inverse propensity-weighted estimators had the highest variance, but still provided sufficient evidence to reject the null hy- pothesis that financial education has no impact on financial health. 7 Quantifying the Causal Effect of Financial Literacy Courses on Financial Health Notably, however, the magnitude of the effect was quite small, ranging from 1.17\u22123.31points from minimum to max across all methods. Relative to the scale of the financial health score used here (average score was 112for treated units, and 115for controls), our results"

This is an indicator that the matched pairs estimator was not ro- bust to scaling in the outcome variable. However, all other estimators still indicated a positive treatment effect at the 5% significance level, indicating that on the whole, there is evidence that HS-based financial education has a positive effect on financial health, even when manipulating the exact financial health measurement function. 8.4.

Conclusion This study used data from the 2021 NFCS to understand the causal effect of financial education on aggregated financial health outcomes. Our results provide strong statistical evidence that financial education positively impacts financial health scores, though the magnitude of that effect is potentially quite weak.

Moreover, these findings suggest that any individual considering financial education is highly likely to benefit from such an education. Future works should focus on devising a more informed formulation for the financial health score, based on domain expertise. None of the authors of this work are primarily involved in the study of finance, education, or long term financial health trajectories. An extension of the current research complemented by domain-expert insight in the out- come variable would likely yield much more interpretable results for estimating the real-world benefit of the ATE. 8 Quantifying the Causal Effect of Financial Literacy Courses on Financial Health 10.

This paper reviews RL applications in QF, encompassing key aspects such as Portfolio Management (PM), option pricing, and asset allocation. However, these potential advantages come with the caveat that RL models must be carefully designed and validated to avoid overfitting and ensure robustness in real-world financial markets.

Despite its potential, applying RL in QF faces significant challenges. QF\u2019s complexity and dynamism considerably surpass RL\u2019s conventional learning tasks. In addition, fully representing the financial environment is a near-impossible feat, necessitating substantial effort to create meaningful features.

As is illustrated here, the first explicit applications of RL to finance can be seen as early as the mid-90s with applications of Critic-only (e.g., [ 240]) and Actor-only (e.g., [ 231]) methods. The early 2000s saw the use of Actor-Critic methods (e.g., [ 63]) with deep-learning methods (e.g., [ 163]) introduced a bit later with multi-agent solutions (e.g., [60]) gaining popularity in recent years. 1.2 Temporal Dynamics in Financial Applications The time unit in the context of QF can vary depending on the specific application.

For example, a reward might be given only at \ud835\udc61+12, representing a delayed return on investment, such as dividends. The RL framework must account for such delayed rewards, ensuring that the agent can still optimise its policy to maximise long-term gains despite the delay.

This can be mainly attributed to the introduction of Deep Q Networks (DQN) [227, 228], and consequently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In other research fields, related concepts were known as trial-and-error learning, learning with a critic, optimal control, and dynamic programming. Therefore, a range of papers [ 117,154,164] link their research to concepts similar to those in RL. Additionally, while multi-armed bandits (MABs) and sequential optimisation methods are significant in online learning and decision-making, they differ from the broader RL framework covered in this survey.

Figure 2, as we covered in subsection 1.1, expands the generic RL framework and illustrates several options for potential mappings between key RL components and relevant concepts, techniques and practices from QF.

Unlike controlled simulation environments, real-world markets are unpredictable and influenced by myriad factors such as information asymmetry, variable transaction costs, taxes, and noise traders, which can significantly affect model performance [ 232,292]. Therefore, a robust validation and simulation process is essential to ensure that RL models accurately capture the complexities of chaotic financial markets.

Many samples drawn from the environment are often necessary for stable convergence and low variance. Techniques such as model-based RL, experience replay, and transfer learning are valuable in this context. Model-free methods are typically slower to learn, whereas model-based methods build a transition model from the environment\u2019s feedback, allowing the agent to use this model to understand the effects of actions on states and rewards [ 258].

In the context of financial applications, agents can reuse previous experiences to improve learning efficiency. Transfer learning enables leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance in new but similar tasks, thus addressing data scarcity [ 183]. For a discussion of transfer learning and model-based RL, see subsection 6.3 and Section 9. When the transition model is accurate, model-based RL can also serve as a transfer learning mechanism, further enhancing learning efficiency [258]. 2.3 Online vs. Offline RL Settings Online learning in QF refers to agents learning and adapting continuously as new data arrive.

[ 135], a potential solution in this setup might be to collect data with a pre-specified exploration scheme during trading hours and update the algorithm with newly collected data after trading closes. Transfer learning can also be leveraged in this context to bridge the gap between offline and online learning. Initially, the RL agent can be pre-trained using offline RL on historical data, learning general strategies and patterns. Once deployed, the agent can then use online learning to fine-tune these strategies in response to real-time market conditions.

This method is particularly useful for backtesting and strategy development, where real-time data streams are not necessary. Offline RL can leverage vast amounts of historical market data to train models and then be deployed in live environments after thorough validation. Furthermore, offline learning does not face the computational constraints that online learning faces, allowing for extensive preprocessing and model training using conventional computing resources.

This means that only actions taken by the current policy generate data at each training iteration. Consequently, the data become unusable after policy updates, making on-policy methods inefficient. However, on-policy algorithms are typically more stable and exhibit lower variance because they learn directly from the policy they are improving [ 258]. For example, SARSA [ 268], an on-policy algorithm, is used in stock trading models due to its ability to adapt to market changes efficiently, resulting in lower computational resources requirements and robust performance under varying market conditions [ 74,83].

The agent, the learner, and decision maker interact with this environment, selecting actions based on state information. This setup requires that the agent and the environment are mutually exclusive [ 296], providing distinct boundaries for rewards, actions, and states6. In financial contexts, the agent, an asset owner, uses the state of financial markets (the environment) and external factors such as stock indices, interest rates, commodity prices, and macroeconomic, political, and natural risks to inform actions (see, Figure 2). Assuming that the agent can access all relevant information, the RL problem can be addressed under the MDP framework [ 28]. However, this assumption implies that the environment is fully observable and that future states depend only on the current state and action, a property known as the Markov property. In financial"

The use of LSTM and RNN models is relevant here, as they can capture long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data. These models help address the limitations of the Markov assumption by incorporating memory effects and providing a dynamic representation of the financial markets.

Early Value-based applications addressed [ 79] this by discretising states, such as binarising technical indicators into bit strings [ 149]. Significant advancements in feature selection and representation occurred after 2016, driven by improvements in DRL and the adoption of neural network (NN) architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [ 178,185,227,228].

Actions, denoted \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61, represent the agent\u2019s interactions with the environment at time \ud835\udc61. In QF-related RL studies, agents typically do not affect the environment, with actions ranging from discrete (e.g., buy or sell decisions) to continuous (e.g., adjusting portfolio weights). Table 3 (in Appendix) presents the action and reward functions from the top fifteen cited papers in our survey. The agent\u2019s objective, encapsulated by the reward signal \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\u2208R\u2282 R, optimises the expected cumulative reward over a sequence of steps, underscoring the preference for long-term gains.

However, setting\ud835\udefe=1can be appropriate and meaningful in specific bounded scenarios where future rewards are equally critical. 5.2 Action Action spaces in RL are typically either continuous or discrete, usually reflected in the agent\u2019s framework. While Value-based methods exclusively accommodate discrete action spaces, alternative methodologies exhibit greater flexibility, rendering them more realistic for financial trading applications. However, the utility of Value-based methods should not be discounted, as the following discussion in subsection 7.2 will reveal.

However, even these sophisticated models employ discrete action spaces. Recently, research has focused on addressing this limitation in DRL, such as Kalashnikov et al.\u2019s [165] QT-Opt method, employing the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for Q-function optimisation.

In single-asset trading systems, typically a single output neuron (activated by a tanh function) is used, the output of which models long and short positions. Such output can be discretised into buy/hold/sell signals with defined thresholds. For multi-asset scenarios, such as in Jiang et al. [ 161,162], the softmax activation function is used to ensure the sum of portfolio weights equals one. Variations of this approach are seen in the literature, where there is a distinction between long and short portfolios [ 318,321].

Sparse rewards present a realistic model of many environments, typically characterising a reward function with predominantly zero values and few positive state-action pairs. Although sparse rewards offer a detailed description of various environments, they can pose challenges in identifying optimal policies due to the infrequent positive feedback [ 258]. Another form of reward function similar to sparse rewards is a conditional reward, in which the reward depends on specific conditions in the state or action.

However, these tasks often assume that training and testing datasets share the same distribution. When distributions shift, models typically need rebuilding with new data, which is inefficient.

Therefore, establishing an opposing position is expected to generate profit when the triplet deviates from the no-arbitrage relationship.

Large language models (LLMs) with remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating texts are promising tools to process and interpret financial regulations, with a rapidly growing number of LLMs available on Hugging Face Hub (Osborne et al., 2024). However, financial regulations and industry standards present unique challenges to the pro- fessional readiness of financial LLMs"

The complex regulatory framework and overlap- ping jurisdictions, such as the fragmented dual federal-state framework in the U.S., make the compliance process challenging (Labonte, 2023). Financial regulation requires processing multi- modal data (Yanglet and Deng, 2024), including, but not limited to, legal texts, financial statements, 1Website: https://coling2025regulations.thefin. ai/homemathematical formulas, tables, figures, and charts. Moreover, LLMs face issues with misinformation and hallucinations, where they generate inaccurate or seemingly plausible but fabricated information (Kang and Liu, 2023). Such hallucinations or mis- information are unacceptable in deployment and can lead to regulatory violations, substantial mon- etary losses, and erosion of trust between compa- nies and their customers (Roberts et al., 2023).

The MOF evaluates and classifies the com- pleteness and openness of machine learning mod- els. The MOF decomposes models into 17 compo- nents, each with specific licensing requirements to ensure openness. LLMs can help the open source community better understand the requirements for model openness and avoid misleading openwash- ing behaviors. Question Set . The question set includes license abbreviations, yes/no questions about whether the Open Source Initiative (OSI) approves licenses, and questions about license requirements outlined in the MOF. Expanding the abbreviations of OSI- approved licenses3and judging OSI approval are essential capabilities for classifying model open- ness. In addition, we also create question-and- answer pairs about model components and their licensing requirements under the MOF. 2.5 XBRL Analytics (Task 9) Task Description . This"

Due to time constraints, we randomly sample 200 ques- tions from stock tickers in abbreviation recog- nition and 90 questions from financial math in XBRL analytics. We also excluded financial ratio formula queries in XBRL analytics."

This report looks into the compatibility of this emerging practice with existing financial regulation. Is AI a more efficient way or a new way of conducting financial business? Can the same rules apply with the development of AI-powered financial services? Are we at a moment in time where, under the disguise of a new technology, we are effectively confronted with a different way of providing financial services necessitating a rethink of existing regulation?

In the following pages this report will look into the functioning of AI, analyse the conse- quences of its modus operandi when applied to financial services and activities, and look into the desirability and the possibility of regulating AI-powered financial services. This can be considered as the first step of the gap analysis to be conducted if EU financial regulation is to be reopened.

While AI itself is merely an umbrella for a variety of algorithm-based technologies that solve complex tasks by carrying out functions that previously required human thinking, its adoption in the financial sector promises enormous efficiency gains to financial service providers (and hence, more profits). The public interest dimension of AI is hardly evident. This report examines the challenges and vulnerabilities that arise with the adoption of AI in financial services. It additionally makes policy proposals to address these risks, ensuring the protection of consumer interests and safeguarding the stability of the financial system as a public good. The very nature of AI is at odds with the fundamental principles underlying deci- sion-making in finance and financial regulation itself \u2013 accountability, responsibility and"

First, there is a fundamental difference between human intelligence and the logic of operation of technologies which came to be called \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d. This difference essentially boils down to the fact that AI draws conclusions and makes predictions based on the correlations detected in the data used for AI model training (inductive logic), whereas human brains are able to reach conclusions with a much broader set of methods, including deduction, abduction, as well as heuristics or in- tuition. Second, the current system of financial regulation (and consequently the financial system itself) is built on the principle of causation, i.e. establishing a logical relationship between the cause and the consequence in every individual case (and not in the aggregate, which is the correlation logic used by AI). The causation principle itself is a pre-condition to a rule-based system with accountability, responsibility and trans- parency. By contrast, AI technologies operate as \u201cblack boxes\u201d \u2013"

This renders the ability of humans to intervene impractical, if not impossible, and is particularly problematic. If AI-driven credit assessments, in- surance pricing, or investment products cannot be adequately explained, customers, investors, and regulators may struggle to detect errors, biases, or systemic risks. Without robust explainability requirements, AI-powered decisions could undermine confidence in the fairness of financial markets. Data manipulation and the inevitable exhaustion of human-generated data to train AI models are further challenges, which present themselves in the context of AI adop- tion, leading to nonsensical results and the un-detectability of falsehood.

The definition of risk as a difference to market returns is also unhelpful, because it ignores the economic changes that will result from climate change.

The capital markets union (CMU) is a plan to create a single market for capital. The aim is to get money \u2013 investments and savings \u2013 flowing across the EU so that it can benefit consumers, investors and companies, regardless of where they are located. A capital markets union will: \u2022 provide businesses with a greater choice of funding at lower costs and provide SMEs in particular with the financing they need; \u2022 support the economic recovery post-Covid-19 and create jobs; \u2022 offer new opportunities for savers and investors; \u2022 create a more inclusive and resilient economy; \u2022 help Europe deliver its new green deal and digital agenda; 27 European Commission, What is the capital markets"

Over the last decade, government education spend - ing has increased steadily, but this has not led to any signifi - cant increases in per child allocations, particularly in LICs, due to rapid population growth. Learning outcomes remain poor, especially in countries that spend the least per school-age child. The World Bank estimates that learning poverty in low- and middle-income countries increased after the pandemic from 57 percent in 2019 to 70 percent in 2022 (Azevedo et al., 2022). The COVID-19 pandemic also strained public finances, reduc - ing the prospects for maintaining pre-pandemic investment levels in education.

In examining trends and patterns in education financing from 2010 to 2022, the report concluded following: \u2022 Although total education spending has increased over the past decade, the amount of funding available is still insuf - ficient to address the learning crisis, especially in LICs. LICs and LMICs have experienced a more rapid annual increase in education spending than wealthier nations, but even those that have reached international education spending benchmarks are struggling to secure enough funding to enable all students to learn effectively. \u2022 LICs and LMICs face a double jeopardy: not only are their financial resources scarce but also often inefficiently used, a persistent issue highlighted in previous EFW editions.

When data are reported late or not at all, it becomes difficult to conduct an analysis of education spending to inform forward-thinking policymaking. This lack of timely and accurate data is a disservice to education, as it hinders the ability to make informed decisions that could improve resource allocations and educational outcomes.

Instead of issuing blurry composite indicators, ESG rating providers should provide separate, standalone sustainability ratings for E, S and G factors, in each case stating if they are assessing financial materiality or impact materiality. Corporate sustainability ratings should be aligned with the EU taxonomy, supervised by ESMA, and subject to high standards for transparency and prevention of conflicts of interest.

Businesses generally assume that ESG investing should focus on the financial conse- quences of sustainability issues on their accounts, an outside-in approach.

The gap between these \u2018financial materiality\u2019 and \u2018impact materiality\u2019 objectives is an obvious recipe for misunderstanding.

The European Commission\u2019s regulatory proposal on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings, expected in June 2023, is an opportunity to provide some much needed clarity around the objectives and structure of ESG ratings so they can better meet the needs of ESG investors and support the EU\u2019s transition to a more sustainable economy. Clarity about the objectives of ESG ratings will also help them to serve as a regulatory tool: some financial supervisors are already using ESG ratings to decide when funds can label themselves as \u2018ESG\u2019 or sustainable and central bankers are starting to think about using them as measures of ESG risk.

This practice has little influence on the sustainability of the world but it describes a large section of the asset management market. Another reason to purchase corporate ESG ratings is to invest on the basis of the antic - ipated ESG performance of a company. For the ESG rating to have predictive value for the investor, the investor needs to know if it matches his or her own ESG objectives. In other words, does it assess financial materiality, impact materiality, or double materiality. There is no typical ESG rating at present. ESG ratings can vary widely because of: \u2022 different approaches to materiality. Many ESG ratings providers look only at financial materiality.

With these differences, there is a low correlation between ESG ratings, as each provider is measuring different things with a different methodology.

For example, investing in fossil fuel companies this year might be financially rewarding if profits stay high but, in the longer-term, climate change means the value of fossil fuel reserves is doomed under all possible scenarios. In light of these features, regulation should ensure that ESG ratings are clear about their objectives, are transparent about methodology, and are coherent with the EU Taxonomy and other regulation.

With that objective in mind, we approach corporate ESG rating in the bigger context of the development of sustainable finance and ESG investing.

In other words, they purchase the ESG ratings that allow them to continue investing more or less as they have always done with as little disruption as possible. ESG rating providers that consider only financial materiality have the best chances of attracting the interest of this (large) section of the asset management market. For obvious reasons, this way"

Behind an ESG rating can lie a single or a double materiality ap- proach, the aggregation using varying keys of very different ESG parameters, and an absolute or a relative assessment of companies\u2019 ESG merits. The one dimension that corporate ESG rating providers have in common is the limited human resources they devote to analysing the rated entities, which makes for an environment focused on the analysis of public documents, information and questionnaires, and where on-the- ground fact-finding, discussion with management and cross-checking has very little, if any, place.

Many ESG rating providers (e.g. MSCI ESG Research, ISS ESG, Refinitiv, Sustainalytics\u2026) assess ESG performance on the basis of financial materiality only. Their objective is to serve the community of investors who see the ESG angle of their investment practice as a way of limiting ESG-linked risks and seizing ESG-linked business opportunities. This approach is the most natural one for investors used to assessing the impact of external factors on companies\u2019 accounts. It is therefore not surprising that it should be dominant.

The financial materiality dimension of ESG analysis is of a different nature from financial analysis as it considers, or should consider, medium and long term sustainability-related financial impacts not taken into account by financial accounting, and therefore financial analysis, today. In summary, in order to be meaningful and therefore useful, corporate ESG ratings should distinguish between the eight possible following dimensions: 1.

Since these functions cannot be distinguished from each other based on their fit to current data, then, given the huge differences in their implications about both the threat from global warming and its immediacy, it is vitally important to decide which functional form is more plausible. The quadratic can be ruled out because its mathematical characteristics contradict the concept of tipping points (Lenton et al. 2008b, 2008a). In particular, a quadratic cannot show a change in the acceleration of damages from global warming, and the economic damages resulting from it.

This has led some to call for more emphasis to be placed on research about the extreme tails of distributions rather than central tendencies.\u201d 41 FSB, \u2018The implications of Climate Change for Financial Stability\u2019, November 2020 24 Finance Watch Report l October 2023Finance is a hot house world \u2794The headline estimate coming out of the FSB assessment (the one everybody quotes, remembers and refers to) is that a temperature increase of 2.5\u00b0C will decrease asset prices between 1.0% and 1.8% and 4\u00b0C between 2.9% and 9.7%.

The economic value of fossil fuel assets follows a binary path: fossil fuel reserves that will be exploited have a value and will keep it; fossil fuel reserves that will be left unex- ploited (be stranded) will eventually have no value. For the oil and gas industry, this is traditionally only a question of whether the reserve is geologically accessible and commercially viable. We define the \u2018exploitable value\u2019 of fossil fuels differently, namely as the value of the reserves that can be exploited if humanity wants to limit global warming to a certain level.

This is sound, basic risk management. To illustrate how it could work, the value of a proven fossil fuel reserve, Vproven, would be reduced to its exploitable value, Vexpl, by multiplying it by a percentage determined by a supervisor as suitable for a given temperature increase (for example, 23% for a target of +2\u00b0C).

Simply put, this is because capital follows the economy, not the other way round.

At their core, the modus operandi of investment portfolio decarbonisation through divestment and of engagement are thus not compatible, even if some investors use the threat of future divestment to add force to their engagement activities. Engagement can take a number of different forms and depends on the framework provided by national corporate laws. It corresponds broadly to the right of shareholders to enter into a dialogue with the management of investee companies, to participate and vote in shareholders\u2019 ordinary and extraordinary general meetings, to propose, under conditions and with legal effects that vary from one jurisdiction to the other, resolutions to be voted in shareholders meetings, and to interact with the board of directors."

Some, whether on the cynics\u2019 or on the critics\u2019 side, see it as the new buzz word for business as usual, while a growing community sees it as the quintessential tool to mitigate climate change by decarbonising the real economy. Which is it to be? International standard setters and policymakers, as well as financial sector business allianc- es such as GFANZ, are working on definitions of net-zero that should help to answer that question. When their work is done, what remains in the \u2018net\u2019 of net-zero will be crucial for determining if the concept will help to decarbonise the economy or risk being discredited as greenwashing tool.

In the background, prudential policymakers continue their work on making financial institutions more resilient to the risks of climate change.73 These two debates \u2013 on net-zero and on climate prudential risks for financial institutions \u2013 are linked by the idea of double materiality, which should be a prominent feature in both policy responses.
