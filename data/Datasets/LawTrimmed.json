It has been often quoted that quarter-power scaling is ubiquitous in biology(Calder, 1996; West et al., 1997). Such quarter-law scaling reinforces, and is reinforced by, the notionthat basal metabolic rate scales as BJM3@4. Nevertheless, the reasons, biological or other- wise, for why a\"3/4 have remained elusive and their elucidation stands as an open theoreticalproblem. A recent surge of interest in the subject,including our own, has been inspired by the el-egant attempt of West et al. (1997) to link nutri- ent-supply networks to metabolic scaling. This work suggests that a fundamental understanding of the relationship between basal metabolism andbody size is within our grasp and that closerinspection of both theory and data are dulywarranted. 0022}5193/01/050009# 19 $35.00/0 (2001 Academic Press *Kleiber\u2019s"

NOVEMBER 1982 The increasing incidence of unscrupulous or even dis- honest trading practices at the expense of the honest trader is considered in an interesting chapter on international trade frauds. The author outlines six of the most typical frauds together with the most effective means of prevention. In some of the cases suggestions as to how the existing prevention measures may be improved are included. The Law of International Trade struck this reviewer as a most versatile book. The author has succeeded in producing a book which is suited both to the law student facing an examination in international trade and the non-lawyer seeking an insight into some or all the topics covered. It is unusual to find a legal text book which is intelligible to the layman but this book achieves it. This is no"

Those situations which are difficult, if not impos- sible to analyse usefully in terms of offer and ac- ceptance (e.g. auction sales without reserve, the situation considered in Clarke v.

This approach is to be welcomed since the student should be aware at the outset that offer and accep- tance is merely a sufficient, but not necessary, criterion of agreement. There is no longer a chapter on written contracts.

Very sensibly, Hayton, the author of the sixth edition, has reorganised the book to reflect the realities of land law today: the registration of title systems is given the textual emphasis it deserves as he describes the structure of land law today in chap- ter 4, and the transmission of title in chapter 5. However, the reader still has to wait until chapter 15 before the mystery posed on page 130 -Rectifi- cation and Indemnity -is fully explained.

It is this reviewer's opinion that the evolving law is NOVEMBER 1982 structured around the cases, and it is only out of the cases that a comprehensible textual structure can emerge for learning purposes. A book, whose struc- ture is primarily taken from the statutory framework, assumes an internal logic to those statutes which is not replicated in the property problems of the real world. It is the judges who give shape and organi- sation to the common law in the cases; we should not allow our thinking to be dictated by the art of the parliamentary draftsman. Subject to this rather general criticism, Hayton has done a good job, though, in places, his prose style lacks the clarity of the original author. \"Goff L.J., in an extempore judgment overlooking his views when Goff J., has endorsed Lord Denning's views when sitting with Lord Denning in D.H.N.
