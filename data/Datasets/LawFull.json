It has been often quoted that quarter-power scaling is ubiquitous in biology(Calder, 1996; West et al., 1997). Such quarter-law scaling reinforces, and is reinforced by, the notionthat basal metabolic rate scales as BJM3@4. Nevertheless, the reasons, biological or other- wise, for why a\"3/4 have remained elusive and their elucidation stands as an open theoreticalproblem. A recent surge of interest in the subject,including our own, has been inspired by the el-egant attempt of West et al. (1997) to link nutri- ent-supply networks to metabolic scaling.

Larger organ- isms are reported to scale allometrically in form so such a deviation may be a result of changesin body shape and hence surface area (Bonner& McMahon, 1983; Calder, 1996).

An increasingly common problem for the courts is to satisfy an expectation to land arising out of expenditure or some representation.

Diane Sonsteng remains my anchor, my advisor, and my best friend.2007] WILLIAM MITCHELL LAW REVIEW Preface This project began for me more than a decade ago. Two colleagues* and I talked about how little we knew about the practice of law when we graduated from law school. We agreed that as new lawyers, we did not understand what it meant to be a lawyer. My colleagues asked why no one was doing anything to improve the legal education system and challenged me to do something about it. The idea for this article was born. For more than a century, law school teaching has relied on an education model that focuses on theory, providing minimal opportunity for students to learn and apply the practical problem- solving skills critical to becoming a competent lawyer in real world settings. Modern learning theory provides direction, and the tools are available for improving the legal education system"

The perspectives and recommendations in this article are presented with the intent of encouraging discussion about the future of modern legal education. This article has two sections. The first section provides an overview of the history and status of legal education. The second section suggests a model for change, and incorporates modern learning theory and teaching tools. It provides answers to criticism as it addresses curriculum, teaching, faculty, and costs. With great hope for the future of the profession and the legal education system, I invite you to consider and address the ideas presented.

In the 1960s, Richard Fosbury went from a mediocre athlete to a world champion when he introduced the \"Fosbury Flop.\" In athletics, the challenge is to run faster, jump farther, and leap higher. In the high jump, like in every other athletic event, rules control. However, no rule existed that controlled how the athletes jumped over the bar. The high jumpers had gone over the bar face down until Fosbury thought outside the box and \"Fosbury Flopped,\" face up, revolutionizing the high jump and dramatically increasing the height to which the athletes could leap. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, Olympic Committee, or Fosbury had not changed the rules. Rather, Fosbury made a revolutionary change within the rules.

Students perform better when they understand why the formula works. Once that understanding is achieved students will 469be more successful at applying the knowledge in other contexts. Knowledge and understanding are more than a disconnected string of memorized facts.470 A second area in need of reform is the failure to recognize students' pre-existing knowledge. It must be accounted for and incorporated into the learning process.471 The perception of students as blank slates influenced entirely by the formal education 472process is false.

Perhaps a constructive exploration of alternative ways of conceiving of and practicing legal education, informed by feminist and critical legal theories, can expand and broaden our collective repertoires. I. Social History The rebirth of the dormant feminist movement in the United States in the 1960s was in part a response to male-radical insistence on using male-dominated hierarchical forms of political organization to accomplish important revolutionary ends.4 While men ran the meetings and formu- lated policy, women were relegated to \"nurturing\" (making coffee) and\"arts and crafts\" (painting placards and posters).

As a self-conscious effort to pull feminism out of its marginal position, the organizers of the 1983 conference on critical legal studies, held at Rutgers-Camden, arranged for a segment of the conference that would focus solely on feminism. Ann Freedman's plan called for all participants to attend one of four simultaneous sessions on feminist theory and the issues feminism brought to any critical theory of law, legal process, and legal education. The feminists who had planned the conference sessions found the planning and debriefing sessions scheduled immediately after the feminist sessions highly stimulating and rewarding. In contrast, the femi- nists found that the sessions themselves elicited male sexist responses, especially painful among fellow radicals."

First, while others (and Duncan Kennedy himself) explore the themes of critical theory for an understand- ing of law and its role in society, we must also look at the process by which law and the myths surrounding it are justified, rationalized, and legitimated to the future makers and practitioners of that law. Thus, we must understand the process of teaching and learning law at the same time that we deconstruct particular doctrines, entire subjects of the law, or the relationship of legal institutions to the larger society.

Unlike other disciplines, the teacher does not lecture but uses a \"Socratic\" teaching method31 in which deductive questions about appellate cases are asked of unwilling students in order to explore the \"underlying logic\" of the cases.

Students are often glad that someone else is \"on the hook,\" and, while \"out there,\" each student feels alone, unsupported, alienated, fearful, and grows increasingly apathetic.

Through Supreme Court interpretations, however, \"equality\" did not always result in equal treatment of women.48 The failure to treat pregnancy as a sex discrimination problem is a flagrant example.

Instead of genuine dialogue, the student's thinking is probed, pushed, and (I have heard it said) \"penetrated\" by the pointed questions asked by the knowing inquisitor.

Here is voiced the tension many of us experienced between our desires to be both caring and ambitious, feminine and successful, driven and reflective. Imagine a spectrum with two images at either extreme. At one end sits the image of Woman, embodying qualities associated with genera- tions of women who themselves had little hand in shaping the image. She lacks public power. She serves other people. She is expected to be and often succeeds in being caring, empathetic, cooperative, and gen- erous. At the opposite end stands the figure of Lawyer, as molded by previous generations of men. He is powerful, instrumental, and adver- sarial. In the middle, vacillating, both attracted to and repelled by each image, we stand.

The C&Ts were secretaries, cashiers, computer programmers, licensed practical nurses, library workers, and laboratory technicians throughout the university. Their union was Local 34. Eighty-two percent of its 2650 members were wo- men; 17 percent were people of color.79 On September 26, 1984, three weeks into the semester, the union voted to strike for higher wages. When its members walked out of the buildings to the sidewalks, leaving their typewriters and files and books for picket signs and megaphones, the average annual salary of a C&T was $13,424.80 Local 34 attributed the low wages to"

By setting the pace of discussion at more than normal speed, a professor may demand quick thinking. By asking a series of leading questions that nudge the student into increasingly extreme responses, a professor may provide a lesson in cross-examination. By taking an ada- mant, one-sided position, a professor may evoke in the student an argu- ment worthy of an opposing advocate.

What they teach. Who's teaching it. The way they want the male legal system to continue. This \"they\" has excluded scholarship by and about women for too long. Speaking to a gathering of teachers of women, the poet and es- sayist Adrienne Rich asked and began to answer the question,"

Without such knowledge women live and have lived without context ... estranged from our own experience because our education has not reflected or echoed it.137 In training for law, establishing ties to the lives of women may mean not only incorporating women's writing into jurisprudence, torts, crim- inal law, contracts, and all the standard courses, not only teaching courses that focus on feminist theory or sex discrimination or repro- ductive rights, but also learning more about the parties to cases be- cause women have more often appeared in courtrooms as plaintiffs"

Almost half looked to the work of women, minorities, non-Americans, or nonlawyers to overcome the \"impression of orthodoxy.\" The women sought to do more than foster respect for diverse viewpoints; they sought continuously to challenge and change the orthodoxy. Our interest in broadening the definition of law does not signal lack of concern for what one woman called \"nuts and bolts\" training. In- deed, ten women wanted more thorough instruction in lawyering skills, including research, writing, and drafting.138 Some, generally those ex- tolling the law school's clinics, saw such skills as essential for service to clients in trouble: \"We should all know how to get people out on bail.\" 137.

I would definitely recommend more active work .... When I was deciding where to go to law school, I went to talk to someone who teaches at N.Y.U.... He told me about how he'd graduated from Yale, and he'd never had to draft a contract, and how he thought that was the worst thing in the world because it made people so afraid to do things on their own that they would end up gravitating to big places [i.e., large law firms] and being afraid to leave because they'd never been forced to actually use law the way most people use it. His theory was that a place like Yale, which supposedly fosters independence, actually rein- forces the status quo .... I thought that was a pretty good theory.

I would criticize the starting point-why the Socratic method?140 It sets some people back unnecessarily and bolsters others harmfully. I don't think we're even producing good litigators, and I don't think we're training for any other skills. Litigators, even, don't always fight with each other. There's no need to argue as if you're going in for the kill. Itjust feeds into stereotypes of what a lawyer is. A different begin- ning message might change the stereotypes.

Legal education would then consist less of adversary training, more of training for \"all the other things lawyers do besides argue in appellate court,\" and some of exploration of new ways to be a lawyer. If law schools implemented these recommendations tomorrow, they would be better places for at least some women, and maybe for some men, too.

LAW IN BOOKS AND LAW IN ACTION. When Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn had determined top rescue Jim by digging under the cabin where he was con- fined, it seemed to the uninformed lay mind of Huck Finn that some old picks the boys had found were the proper implements to use. But Tom knew better. From reading he knew what was the right course in such cases, and he called for case-knives. \"It don't make no difference,\" said Tom, \"how foolish it is, it's the right way-and it's the regular way. And there ain't no other way that"

He dropped his knife and, turn- ing to Huck, said firmly, \" Gimme a case-knife.\" Let Huck tell the rest: \"He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down and says, 'Gimme a case-knife.' \"I didn't know just what to do-but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work and never said a word. \"He was always just that particular.

American legal reasoning assumes that there are overarch- ing legal principles. The facts of a case form the minor premise of a syllogism; the applicable legal principle constitutes the ma- jor premise. The American legal system is also hierarchical; trial court decisions are subject to at least two levels of appel- late review.

LEGAL EDUCATION-THE FIRST YEAR This study considered what happens when individuals who view the world from a relational-care perspective undertake professional training that is defined from a justice-rights per- spective. The study hypothesized that the first year of legal training alters students' moral decision-making processes.66 American law schools generally offer a standard, mandatory, first-year curriculum that teaches concepts funda- mental to legal thinking and practice. James Elkins describes the first year of law school as a powerful, transformative rite of passage.67 He reports that students quickly come to mistrust their perceptions of themselves, of lawyers, and of themselves as lawyers.68 Elkins's studies reveal that students are often stopped in their tracks by questions about what they are doing, how the law works, what it \"actually\" means to"

Interview Data Interpreted for Rights The Real-Life Moral Conflict and Choice Interview pro- vided additional data on gender difference in problem construc- tion and resolution. At the beginning of the first year of law school, ten of the fifteen men interviewed, but only one of the fifteen women interviewed, perceived moral conflict as an issue involving rights or justice considerations. This demonstrates that men who chose to come to Temple University School of Law in 1989 viewed themselves and their relationships with others predominantly from a rights perspective. That is, the men tended to resolve conflicts by appealing to equity and fair- ness, by respecting autonomy, and by assuming that each indi- vidual possesses preordained rights. Kohlberg's model provides a traditional description of that perspective: Justice is not a rule or a set of rules; it is a moral principle."

When individuals see themselves and others as different but connected, moral dilem- mas are resolved by stepping into, not back from, the situation; by assessing need; and by taking action based on that knowledge.19' Gilligan also claims that the rights and care perspectives are not mutually exclusive.192 Although both moral constructs are available to women and men, each gender tends to use one perspective predominantly. The important question for moral theorists,"

Is the adversarial model the only route to dispute resolution? Is a highly compet- itive learning environment the best way to educate students? Would law schools serve their purposes better by integrating a perspective of responsiveness? Why is there resistance to in- cluding the full range of mature moral sensibility and personal judgment in legal training? The integration of care and rights thinking requires educa- tors to change the traditional structure of legal education, not just assimilate women within the existing structure.

Continued suppression of the voice of care will block the harmony of a fully human response. An integrated legal education and practice can occur only if there is extensive dialogue between these two perspectives. This dialogue has already begun with the feminist critique of legal education. Feminist jurisprudence criticizes hierarchy and encourages law schools to include women's experiences and perspective. It also calls for legal educators to revise their as- sumptions about the legal system. Feminist scholars further in- sist that law schools refrain from ranking and sexualizing the dualisms of human experience. Continued investigation and exploration will extend the dialogue and encourage law schools to fulfill their missions and incorporate the resources of men and women. 211.

An especially important implication of this theory of the law's auto- poietic character is that the boundaries of the system must be drawn dif- ferently than has been customary (even in the way sociologically oriented systems theory has dealt with law). Up to now the law has been treated either from the perspective of jurisprudence, as a complex of norms, or as a system of knowledge, in abstraction from real social behavior. Jurists saw the legal system as a macro-text. Or, as is customary in sociology, the focus was shifted to institutions that are concerned with law on a full- time basis, whether those institutions were organizations (primarily the courts), or the legal profession.

For all its ambiva- lence, this perspective has left a definite mark on jurists' attitudes toward the relationship between law and politics.7 Assuming that the system has a self-referential, closed character leads to completely different notions about the boundaries of the system. They are defined not at the institutional but at the operative level.

At this point the question of the basis and the justification for legal validity leads us to assume an escalating relationship between closedness and openness in a system. Only as a self-referential closed system can the legal system develop \"responsiveness\" to social interests.19 Viewed in this way, evolution selects (on the level of organisms as well as on the level of social systems) forms that permit greater complexity in combin- ing closedness and openness. But that certainly does not mean better adaptation to the powers that be; it does not mean more efficient corruption.

In urging that anti- discrimination laws be liberated from existing standards of intentionality, Lawrence argues that, as a matter of history, culture, and psychology, American racism is pervasive and largely unconscious: Americans share a common historical and cultural heritage in which racism has played and still plays a dominant role. Because of this shared experience, we also inevitably share many ideas, attitudes, and beliefs that attach significance to an individual's race and induce negative feelings and opinions"

During his doctoral research on The force of the aortic heart (Poiseuille 1828), Poiseuille invented the U-tube mercury manometer (called the hemodynamometer) and used it to measure pressures in the arteries of horses and dogs.

His observations of the mesenteric microcirculation of the frog (Poiseuille 1835) revealed that blood flow in the arterioles and venules features a plasma layer at the vessel wall in which there are few red cells, that \"plasma-skimming\" occurs at vessel bifurcations, and that white cells tend to adhere to the vessel wall.

In the case of a soft solid (plastic substance) the so-called viscosity is not the same for all rates of shear: whereas the viscosity of a liquid is a physical constant and should be named. This usage is then found in the standards literature as early as 1918 (Perry 1955) and in later literature on weights, measures, and units (CGPM 1948, Mechtly 1964). As a practical matter, the capillary viscometer is a simplified version of Poiseuille's test equipment, and its use is based on PoiseuiIIe's law with interpretation based on Hagenbach's derivation, Equation (3). It is interesting to take stock of progress made toward Poiseuille's original goal of understanding the laws of pressure distribution in a living circulation of blood. A great deal has been learned about the properties of blood cells and the flow of blood in the 20th century. When all is said and done, Poiseuille's law is a good"

        "text": "approximation for blood flow provided the appropriate value for the apparent viscosity is used. Therein lies the rub. Red blood cells are very flexible and at low shear rates they aggregate into stacks called rouleaux. At higher shear stresses, disaggregation and deformation of the cells leads to decreasing viscosity (see Chien et a11984, for example). Nevertheless, when bulk viscosity measurements are made (in large tubes) and compared to the apparent viscosity derived from tube flows in smaller tubes at the same hematocrit (cell concentration) and mean shear rate, the results agree quite closely for diameters down to about 29 tlm (Barbee & Cokelet (1971). Blood cells tend to move away from blood vessel walls [as observed by Poiseuille (1835) and many others] in small diameter vessels. This leads to a reduction in apparent viscosity as the diameter decreases-known as the Fahraeus-Lindqvist (1931) effect. However, it has been shown that this result is largely due to the reduction in hematocrit which results"

At sufficiently small diameters (D < 8 mm) there is a reverse Fahraeus-Lindqv isteffect, namely, the apparent viscosity increases with decreasing capillary diameter because the blood cells fill most of the lumen (Skalak 1990); so Poiseuille's law no longer holds. As a direct proof of the extent of applicability of Poiseuille's law to the in vivo flow of blood, a summary of measurements due to Lipowsky et al (1978) is shown in Figure 5. A good correlation of the resistance per unit length of vessel is obtained with the exponent of vessel radius close to 4.0. Surely Poiseuille would have been glad to see this! Poiseuille's law is one of the few equations derived from applied mech\u00ad anics that is well known in the present medical community. It has been used to model other biological flows, besides blood flow."

        "text": "for sedimenting particles, Poiseuille's law allows an approximate length scale to be defined characterizing the geometry of laminar flows where the geometry is, in fact, much more complex. Extensions of Poiseuille's law are legion, depending on which definition of an extension is adopted. A broad definition might be classes of flows which, in some limit of the range of the parameters involved, reduce again to Poiseuille's law. Thus, Poiseuille's law is one example of exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (see Wang 1991 for a comprehensive dis\u00ad cussion). A case of interest to blood flow is the exact solution of the sinusoidally oscillatory rectilinear flow of a Newtonian fluid in a circular tube. This solution has also been published independently several times (McDonald 1974), but is known in the blood flow literature through the work of Womersley (1955) and McDonald (1974). At sufficiently low dimensionless frequency [0: = a(w/v)1/2 where a is the tube radius and w is the frequency], the oscillatory"

The theory of these flows was given by Stokes (1898) who showed that the parabolic Poiseuille velocity profile was obtained in each component of velocity parallel to the bounding plates. He also pointed out the analogy of Hele-Shaw flows to two-dimensional inviscid flow. Extensions and uses of Poiseuille flow listed above are just a few cases which readily come to mind. The authors apologize for neglect of the many additional cases and categories not covered in which the name ofPoiseuille is involved. However, one of the most recent such references indicates how far afield Poiseuille's influence has extended (Chamkha 1991). Surely, Poiseuille would be surprised to see his name in the title: \"Series solution for unsteady hydromagnetic Poiseuille two-phase flow.\" It shows how long and far the influence of Poiseuille has been manifest."
