It has been often quoted that quarter-power scaling is ubiquitous in biology(Calder, 1996; West et al., 1997). Such quarter-law scaling reinforces, and is reinforced by, the notionthat basal metabolic rate scales as BJM3@4. Nevertheless, the reasons, biological or other- wise, for why a\"3/4 have remained elusive and their elucidation stands as an open theoreticalproblem. A recent surge of interest in the subject,including our own, has been inspired by the el-egant attempt of West et al. (1997) to link nutri- ent-supply networks to metabolic scaling. This work suggests that a fundamental understanding of the relationship between basal metabolism andbody size is within our grasp and that closerinspection of both theory and data are dulywarranted. 0022}5193/01/050009# 19 $35.00/0 (2001 Academic Press *Kleiber\u2019s"

The traditional division of property law into land law and equity and trusts provides the raw student with a distorted approach to his understanding; he finds it difficult to integrate subjects which are separated into two textbooks, and usually twocourses: land law becomes a \"difficult\" subject as a con- sequence. An increasingly common problem for the courts is to satisfy an expectation to land arising out of expenditure or some representation.

Diane Sonsteng remains my anchor, my advisor, and my best friend.2007] WILLIAM MITCHELL LAW REVIEW Preface This project began for me more than a decade ago. Two colleagues* and I talked about how little we knew about the practice of law when we graduated from law school. We agreed that as new lawyers, we did not understand what it meant to be a lawyer. My colleagues asked why no one was doing anything to improve the legal education system and challenged me to do something about it. The idea for this article was born. For more than a century, law school teaching has relied on an education model that focuses on theory, providing minimal opportunity for students to learn and apply the practical problem- solving skills critical to becoming a competent lawyer in real world settings. Modern learning theory provides direction, and the tools are available for improving the legal education system"

Universities effectively had no option but to buy out incumbents, presumably at the expected difference between their academic remuneration and their earnings in their next best occupation. After passage of the Act, universities would only need to pay statutory redundancy pay based on a fraction of historical earnings, which is normally regarded as a rather low level of compensation. It is probably now much cheaper, at least in principle, for universities to create redundancies if they can meet the criteria specified in the Act. Dnes & Seaton,"

They learn that work in law is hierarchical-the best students work at the \"best\" firms (because they attract the students with the highest grades, pay the most money, and provide legal services for the rich and powerful). Certain kinds of practice are valued over others (corporate over family law, for example), and federal court is more prestigious than state court if one litigates (but these days the transaction planner is valued more highly than the litigator). Similarly, teachers are stratified in complex reputational ladders of elite, national, regional, and local schools,34 and by subject matter, reflecting some of the stratification of law practice.35"

And, until quite recently, law teachers were almost exclusively white, middle-class males, so that authority, intelligence, and correctness were coextensive with white, middle-class maleness.36 Students looking for mentors or models in teachers who looked demographically like themselves would get the mes- sage that they did not belong unless they were white and male.

One strategy rejects sexualization by accept- ing a model of equality that assumes that men and women are the same and that qualities and institutions cannot be genderized. Olsen finds, however, that hierarchization still functions because \"male\" qualities are still valued more highly, whether displayed by women or men.
