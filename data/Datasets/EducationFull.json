For instructors to effectively teach using automated assessment systems, they must decide when and how to assign repetitive lower -level learning to grading systems and when to implement feedback systems for higher -level conceptual learning. TBAAS can support conceptual understanding by analyzing students' written response' content, providing instructors with classifications by meaning , and promoting student reflection and metacognition. Alternatively, systems can support problem identification and troubleshooting with detailed knowledge of student responses, grades, and automatic feedback. Instructors should incorporate TBAAS into clas sroom practice for holistic feedback and evaluations, rather than numerical evaluation alone. It is necessary to apply the appropriate automated assessment system to a learning context and to investigate its impact"

This has always been a challenge for large classes where instructors cannot grade the written answers and have preferred multiple -choice questions alone. Goncher et al. (2016) point out that \"the dissimilarity between the software output and the human coder output suggests that it may be unlikely that an automated assessment of textual data will be able to assess students' explanations as accurately as that of a human \" (p. 219).

Excluding book chapters may have limited the scope of our findings on automated assessment tools and methods. Second , we only searched for studies written in English , meaning studies related to this topic but written in other languages were not considered . This is a limitation of excluding potentially relevant studies on language alone. Third, although we used a comprehensive approach for the systematic review, the standard limitations of the systematic review process apply.

Compared to using single -best-answer questions in assessment , short -answer question format s have demonstrated higher degrees of reliability and validity, and items are perceived as more authentic (Sam et al., 2018) .

Excluding stakeholders\u2014like students and teachers\u2014from the design process can potentially lead to mistrust and inadequately aligned tools. Despite a shift towards human-centred design in recent LA and AIED research, there remain gaps in our understanding of the importance of human control, safety, reliability, and trustworthiness in the design and implementation of these systems.

Results indicate some consideration of human control in LA/AIED system design, but limited end-user involvement in actual design. Based on these findings, we recommend: 1) carefully balancing stakeholders\u2019 involvement in designing and deploying LA/AIED systems throughout all design phases 2) actively involving target end-users, especially students, to delineate the balance between human control and automation, and 3) exploring safety, reliability, and trustworthiness as principles in future human-centred LA/AIED systems.

In educational contexts, AI and learning analytics (LA) innovations are prompting a significant transfor- mation by both enabling innovative teaching and learning strategies (Markauskaite et al., 2022) and, at the same time, challenging current assessment practices (Swiecki et al., 2022). Emerging LA and AI in Education (AIED) systems offer novel data-intensive solutions that promise to enable adaptive and personalised teaching and learning experiences at scale. For instance, various intelligent tutoring systems and LA solutions provide personalised learning support and automated feedback (e.g. Maier and Klotz, 2022; Cavalcanti et al., 2021).

The two-dimensional HCAI framework proposed by Shneiderman (2020b) (see Section 2.1.1) provides a frame of reference to analyse the human control/automation balance. This motivates our third research question: RQ3: What levels of human control and computer automation have been considered in various types of human-centred LA/AIED systems designed with the involvement of stakeholders? As mentioned above, some researchers have increasingly recognised the importance and potential of HCAI in the current LA/AIED literature landscape (e.g., Renz and Vladova, 2021; Zhao et al.).

The concept of accountability refers to individuals or systems being responsible for their decisions and the consequences of their actions. This is discussed in only four studies, taking a perspective from system usage (i.e., Zhou et al., 2021; Duan et al., 2023; Lawrence et al., 2023) and design (i.e., Gibson et al., 2017). The study by Zhou et al. (2021) sees accountability from a system usage perspective. For them, accountability is not just about the teachers overseeing the system; it also involves students taking responsibility for adjusting their learning"

For instance, robust data privacy measures (e.g., Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2019; Ngoon et al., 2023) and transparent data collection procedures (e.g., Conijn et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2022) can enhance the perceived safety of the system, thereby fostering trust among users.

        "text": "literature review indicate a growing interest in human-centred LA and AIED research. The review highlights the importance of safety, reliability, and trust in the design and implementation of these data- intensive systems, as well as the need for transparent, effective communication and user control. The review also identifies gaps in the existing research and methodological challenges that need to be addressed for human-centred LA and AIED to remain relevant and potentially become part of mainstream practices in the foreseeable future. Overall, this review provides valuable insights into the current state of human-centredness in LA and AIED studies with support HCAI framework as a lens, and underscores the importance of ongoing research and development.

Specifically, educa- tional data mining methods have been widely adopted in different aspects such as cognitive diagnosis, knowledge tracing, content rec- ommendations, as well as learning analysis [12, 84, 148\u2013151, 187]. As large language models (LLMs) have become a powerful par- adigm in different areas [ 23,47,73,199], they also achieved state- of-the-art performances in multiple educational scenarios [ 78,101, 192]. Existing work has found that LLMs can achieve student-level performance on standardized tests [ 136] in a variety of mathematics subjects (e.g., physics, computer science) on both multiple-choice and free-response problems."

A recent study [ 164] reveals that ChatGPT is capable of generating logically consistent answers across dis- ciplines, balancing both depth and breadth. Another quantitative analysis [ 120] shows that students using ChatGPT (by keeping or refining the results from LLMs as their own answers) perform better than average students in some courses from the field of computer security. Recently, several perspective papers [ 77,166] also explore various application scenarios of LLMs in classroom teaching, such as teacher-student collaboration, personalized learning, and assess- ment automation. However, the application of LLMs in education may lead to a series of practical issues, e.g., plagiarism, potential bias in AI-generated content, overreliance on LLMs, and inequitable access for non-English speaking individuals [78].

Besides these, for education domain, the concern of overreliance is also a major concern as over-depending on LLMs will harm some key capabilities of students such as critical thinking, academic writ- ing, and even creativity. 4.1 Fairness and Inclusiveness Limited by LLM training data, where representations of specific groups of individuals and social stereotypes might be dominant, bias could develop [ 212].

Online Learning. Online learning, also known as e-learning or virtual learning, takes place through digital platforms where students and instructors interact remotely. Unlike traditional classroom settings, online education leverages digital technologies to facilitate teaching and learning pro- cesses, often through platforms that support video lectures, interactive modules, and various forms of communication [108], [110]. This mode of learning not only allows for asyn- chronous learning but also enables real-time interaction be- tween instructors and students across different geographical locations.

Similarly, dynamic mouse records, captured through digital logs, track real-time mouse movements and clicks, revealing patterns of interaction and levels of user engagement [109]. In addition, evaluation records and digital logs of student scores offer a chronological account of assessments and academic achievements [102], [107].

Forecasting grades typically involves predicting or esti- mating student grades at the course level based on features of academic performance data and learning behavioral data, such as attendance records, assignments, and test scores [30], [32]. Educators use this process to anticipate student upcoming performance in assessments or courses, aiming to predict the numerical or letter grades they are likely to achieve.

The continuous nature of these performance indicators makes them critical components in constructing accurate predictive models, providing ongoing feedback throughout the course duration [30], [175], [176]. Addition- ally, data from learning management systems, which record detailed student activity logs including login frequencies, assignment submissions, resource accesses, and interactions in discussion forums, are instrumental [177], [178].

Classification models are at the fore- front of analyzing learning behaviors due to their ability tocategorize complex behavioral patterns effectively. Decision tree classifiers, for instance, categorize student behaviors such as participation, submission punctuality, and online activity levels [37], [59]. By identifying and classifying these behaviors, educators can tailor interventions to address specific issues, such as providing additional resources to stu- dents who consistently submit assignments late or offering motivational support to those who show declining partic- ipation.

LSTM can be used to forecast engagement trends to provide accurate predictions of future behavior, which are then classified into specific behavior categories using decision tree classifiers [147]. In addition, clustering models further enhance the analysis of learning behaviors by grouping students based on their classified behavioral patterns.

BACKGROUND Most of the traditional data mining techniques focus on data dependencies or simple patterns and do not focus on the process as a whole and do not provide visual representation of the complete educational process ready to be analyzed [6]. However, EPM techniques aim to extract process-related knowledge from event logs recorded by an information system [13]. In fact, nowadays there are an increasing number of examples about the applicability of process mining in education. Process mining has been used to extract"

Petri nets analysis has been used to find learning paths or to optimise the path that a student must follow in order to reach a degree or a qualification [4]. Bottleneck mining and petri net simulation have been used to detect discrepancies between the flows prescribed in a student\u2019s registration model and the actual pr ocess instances [2]. Heuristic Mining has been used to analyze students\u2019 writing activities to improve not only the quality of the written document but more importantly the writing skills of those involved [11].

Proposed approach vers us the traditional approach. The traditional approach uses all event log data to reveal a process model of student\u2019s behaviour. On the other hand, this proposed approach firstly applies clustering in order to group st udents with similar marks or characteristics. It then applies process mining to discover more specific models of student beha viour. We propose two different clustering/grouping approaches: \uf0b7 Manual : To group students directly using only the students\u2019 marks obtained in the final exam of the course. \uf0b7 Automatic : To group students using a clustering algorithm over the student\u2019s interaction with the Moodle\u2019s course. 4.

Each unit was composed of three different types of contents: \uf0b7 Declarative knowledge level : Theoretical contents, description, information, and how-to put the \u201clearn to learn\u201d strategy or strategies of the week into practice. \uf0b7 Procedural knowledge level: Practical tasks where the students had to put their declarative knowledge into practice. \uf0b7 Conditional knowledge level: Discussion forums where the students had to discuss about how they had or would use the strategy"

We used this algorithm because it is a well-known clustering algorithm that does not require the user to specify the num ber of clusters to find. In our case, we obtained three clusters with the following distribution of students: \uf0b7 Cluster 0 : 23 students (22 pass and 1 fail). \uf0b7 Cluster 1: 41 students (39 pass and 2 fail). \uf0b7 Cluster 2 : 20 students (13 fail and 7 pass).

Heuristic Miner can be used to express the main behaviour registered in an event log.

In summary, both Figures 2 and 3, show the most typical behaviour of the students in each case/dataset. But, it is interesting to see that the heuris tic net of students who failed is smaller than the heuristic net of all students. From an educational and practical point of view (to be able to use this information for providing feedback to instructors about student learning), it could easily be used to point out new students at risk of failing the course. For example, instructors only have to check if new students follow the same specific routes/behavioural patterns that shown by the heuristic net of students who failed.

CONCLUSIONS In the present work, we propose to use clustering to improve educational process mining and, at the same time, optimise both the performance/fitness and comprehensibility/size of the model obtained. In particular, the comprehensibility of the model is a core goal in education due to the transferral of basic knowledge that it entails. Making graphs, m odels or visual representation more accessible or at least, accessible, to teachers and students, makes these results very useful for monitoring the learning process and providing feedback, one of our future goals being to do it in real time. Furthermore, Moodle does not provide specific visualization tools of students\u2019 us age data that let the different agents of the learning process understand these large amounts of raw data and become aware of what is happening in distance learning, apart from extending the use of the results to Adaptive Hypermedia Learning"

Thus, there is an increasing demand for high-quality longitudinal educational research in Germany. In particular, there is a clear need to work on improving the analytical and methodological tools needed to understand educational pathways through the life course and how they lead to different outcomes. The National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) for Germany has been designed to meet these challenges.

It also serves as a bridge between psychological and socio- logical perspectives and between individual development and social structure. Thus, the life course provides an excellent framework for studying education at the nexus of social pathways, developmental trajectories, and social change (Baltes et al. 1999; Diewald and Mayer 2009; Elder and Giele 2009; Elder et al. 2003; see also Chap. 2, this volume).

NEPS also offers trai- nings on the use of the database. The aim is to prepare data from all starting cohorts so quickly that they become available in an anonymous form for both national and inter - national scientists 18 months after the end of fieldwork.

Developmental psychologists often work with the noti- ons of stages, progressions, growth, and evolution (Dannefer 1984; Lewontin 2000). The resulting emphasis is on systematic pathways of development (change) over time. With regard to competence development, there are two major relevant issues that, nonetheless, possess"

Sociological life-course approaches, while incorporating these individual differences and notions of law-like development such as aging, emphasize variability and exogenous influences on the course of development over time that cannot be predicted by focusing solely on enduring individual traits or ontogenetic past experiences. As a result, impor - tant aspects of educational careers are time-varying educational contexts that foster or hinder learning and educational progress. The sociological life-course perspective there- fore focuses on the emergent properties over the life course based on structural experien- ces (Sampson and Laub 2004).

In Germany, ele- mentary and lower secondary educational institutions are strictly age-graded. Educational curricula require the completion of a specific number of hours; courses must be tackled in a specific sequence; and time limits are set for obtaining certificates. However, Germany does have a more informal age structuring after the end of compulsory schooling in voca- tional, tertiary, and further education in which the degree of formal time structuring is not as exacting. Therefore, it is important to examine how individuals regulate their develop- ment in the face of \u201cnonnormative\u201d demands of formal institutions after compulsory school, because individuals must then adopt a more active role to compensate for the lack of structure.

The conceptual tool of trajectory encompasses both sequen- ces of different qualitative states and continuous increases or decreases in quantita- tive characteristics such as competence development or skill trajectory. Careers can be distinguished from career lines, a sequence of educational positions common to the experience of many individuals (Spenner et al. 1982). Educational career lines often depend strongly on structural features of the educational systems, and thus draw atten- tion to the ways in which opportunity structures shape the educational careers of indivi- duals (Spilerman 1977).

Natriello (1994) discusses tracking, ability grouping, age grouping, and interest grouping as the most common wit- hin-school stratification mechanisms in modern societies. These mechanisms structure educational career lines by opening up some doors and closing others.

The second one points to the possibility of a narrowing of the inequality gap (O\u2019Rand and Henretta 1999). Educational research has paid relatively little attention to the challenges of describing and explaining long-term educational tra- jectories, because longitudinal data have rarely been available over longer time spans. Finally, the life-course perspective implies that educational careers should not be studied in isolation from events in other domains of life at the level of the individual, because most life domains are interdependent in complex ways (Mayer and Tuma 1990).

NEPS can add empirical evidence to this discussion, because it measures variables such as domain-general and domain-specific cognitive competencies. Cameron and Heckman (1998) have also suggested that individuals do not just concentrate on the next respective educational transition in their educational decision making, but choose the ultimate level of schooling that maximizes their net returns to schooling, and that all of the succes- sive transitions are governed by this more long-term view.

Over the last three decades, two different models of causal inference have domi- nated the work of practitioners in educational research: (a) causation as robust depen- dence and (b) causation as consequential manipulation.

Thus, in this approach, causation is established essentially through the elimination of spurious (or noncausal) influences. Although this approach has dominated the social sciences for several decades, nowadays, it is clearly considered to be too limited. In particular, when cross-sectional data are used, a major problem is that these data cannot establish the time order of cause and effect variables. Therefore, the researcher has to make strong assumptions about the direction of causality. Second, because scientists rarely know all the causes of observed effects or how they relate to one another, it is impossible to be sure that all other important variables actually have been controlled (Shadish et al. 2002)."

The panel design of NEPS is particularly strong in dealing with the threats of unit heterogeneity and temporal instability (Allison 1994; Halaby 2004; Hsiao 1986; Maddala 1987).

According to Cox (1990, 1992), one crucial precondition for claiming a causal link is for there to be an elaboration of an underlying generative process that exists in time and space. A causal association between X and Y must be considered as being produced by a process and being created by some (substantive) mechanism. A major shortcoming of the approaches of causation as robust dependence and causation as consequential mani- pulation is that no explicit notion of an underlying generative process is present in these models.

For example, when a student enters a new school, it will take some time before any effect at all can be observed on her or his 28 H.-P. Blossfeld and J. von Maurice competence level. This time interval may be very short or very long, but can never be zero or infinite (Kelly and McGrath 1988). In some causal relationships, effects occur almost instantaneously.

Hence, the cohorts starting in the institutional context of Kindergartens, schools, and universities were based on a multistage sampling approach using as primary sampling units the Kindergarten, the school, or the field of study. Since the initial survey, all respondents have been followed up as far as possible in their institutional contexts.

A sampling design with sample size n is called simple random sampling if every combi- nation of n units from the population is equally likely to be chosen. In most cases, it is neither possible nor desirable to draw a simple random sample. Because the main goal of any survey is to gain estimates that are as precise as possible, sampling designs that differ from simple random sampling might increase their precision. On the other hand, simple random sampling might be infeasible when no sampling frame including all population units is available. In the context of sampling school children, simple random 40 C.

        "text": "also undesirable, because other designs (e.g., stratified sampling) are more efficient. Stratified sampling means that the target population is partitioned into subpopulations (called strata), and then samples are drawn independently from each stratum. There are several possible strategies for allocating the total sample size to the different strata. If the sample sizes are proportional to the population sizes within each stratum, this is called proportional allocation and results in equal sampling rates across strata (and usually in more precise estimates for characteristics of the whole population). Because the preci- sion of estimates for subpopulations depends mainly on the sample size within these sub- populations, varying sampling rates across strata might be a reasonable way to increase the precision of estimates for special groups (using higher sampling rates among certain strata is called oversampling). Thus, stratified sampling has two main advantages: It gen- erally leads to more precise estimates"

In cluster sampling, a sample (possibly stratified) is drawn in such a way that clusters of units are selected at once. In one-stage cluster sampling, every unit in each selected cluster is surveyed. Usually, however, only a sample of units within each selected clus- ter will be drawn; this is called two-stage sampling or (if subclusters are drawn within the first-stage clusters) multistage sampling. Cluster sampling is likely to reduce the precision of estimates compared to simple random sampling (with equal sample size), because units within clusters tend to be more similar than units in different clusters. This is often outweighed, however, by the advantages of cluster sampling: First, in some applications, lists of clusters are the only available sampling frame (for surveys of school children, lists of schools are available, but complete lists of all children are"

Second, cluster sampling is usually much cheaper than individual-based sampling (e.g., testing children within the same school can be done more quickly and more cheaply than testing the same number of children in different schools). Third, cluster sampling is appropriate to measure context effects. For all three reasons, NEPS uses multistage cluster sampling when applicable. Stratification and cluster sampling may be combined, resulting in stratified multistage cluster samples. Within each stratum, units or clusters might be sampled with designs that differ from simple random sampling. Often, the sampling frame is ordered by some variables, and then a systematic sample is drawn. The precision of the resulting estimates is similar to the results of stratification with proportional allocation, and therefore this procedure is called implicit stratification in contrast to explicit stratification as described above (implicit stratification is usually done within explicit strata).

However, due to the augmentation sample of 1st-grade stu- dents, the panel cohort increased to 9,337 before Wave 3. Attrition from the panel was quite small up to Wave 6, with 9,331 Kindergarten children still in the panel in Wave 4; 9,282, in Wave 5; and 9,044, in Wave 6. The attrition rate peaked clearly after Wave 6. This could be attributed partially to the summation of parent withdrawals in previous studies. Until Wave 6, the affected target persons could be surveyed and tested despite any parental withdrawal. However, in Wave 7, all school children transitioned to the indi- vidual field, and surveying had to continue in the family home, which was inconceiv- able for children with parent withdrawal. For this reason, 526 target persons had to be dropped from the panel sample. In SC2, the participation"

The peaks in temporary and final dropouts within Wave 6 apply to a large extent to the subsample of Kindergarten children who were not surveyed and tested again until Wave 6 because they had transitioned to an ele- mentary school that was not being tracked institutionally. These students are now part of the individual field. Zinn et al. (2018) provides a more detailed presentation of the panel progress. The figures in Table 10 in Zinn et al.

These sampling techniques are especially suited to incorporate the institutional settings into the sampling process. As long as individu- als are participating in formal educational institutions such as Kindergartens, schools, or institutions of higher education, well-defined clusters exist\u2014and they are being used. Multistage sampling procedures can also be tailored to cope with the different focuses of the six starting cohorts.

Data on the development of competencies serves as a central point of reference for all other parts of the study. These competencies have to be relevant not only for a successful and responsible individual life but also for a well-functioning modern democratic society. Hence, the aim is not just to describe the development of such competencies, but also to analyze relevant prerequisites, condi- tions, and courses of competence acquisition. The lifelong learning perspective will shed light on how different competencies are acquired over the life span, how they interact over time and across educational stages, and in which way they may contri- bute to individual and group-specific life-course outcomes.

These domain- and demand-specific competencies are distinguished from both (a) (primary) domain-general and rather context-free cognitive capacities (e.g., fluid intelligence or working memory capacity) and (b) specialized content-specific knowledge structures and procedural skills. Furthermore, educationally relevant competencies are often conceptualized as either cur - ricular (i.e., subject-bound) or cross-curricular (i.e., cross-subject).

These intervals are shorter during lower stages in which greater changes are expected, whereas they become longer in older cohorts. An important issue refers to the ways of linking competence scores across time in order to be able to analyze developmental change over the life course. Different linking strategies are employed in the assessment design (see Fischer et al. 2016): The tests for mathematical literacy are connected through common items, whereas tests for reading competence and scientific literacy have no common items in consequent assessment waves and are, therefore, linked via separate linking studies in which test instruments from two adjacent waves are administered to an additional sample. Whereas at the beginning of NEPS, testing was paper-based and usually only one ins- trument was prepared to measure"

Also, emphasis is placed on the methodological and technological advancement of computer-based competence tests that not only allow for difficulty-tiered and adaptive testing but also open up the possibility to use complex tasks (e.g., simulation tasks) and to analyze incidentally generated log- and process data as indicators of competence assessment. 76 S. Weinert et al. All in all, the measurement of competencies over the life span is one of the major challenges facing NEPS. As well as selecting a broad, but nevertheless limited number of competencies to be included in NEPS, it is important to operationalize these com- petencies within a coherent framework and to convert them adequately into assessment instruments for all age groups and cohorts."

It is also consistent with recent theoretical developments in the psychology of motivation and interests that stress the role of the environment in offering support for autonomy, competence, and social relatedness (Ryan and Deci 2000). Support, however, needs to be perceived and taken up by the learner. From a systems theory point of view, the interplay of opportunities and their use can be understood as describing the exchange between the social-interactive and personal systems that constitute the basic operations of the edu- cational system (Luhmann 2002).

It is not learning itself that is formal, nonformal, or informal, but the context in which it takes place.

On the level of learning environments, interest focuses on the quality of single learn- ing opportunities. One can ask how many persons attend different learning environments (e.g., private lessons, music lessons, sport clubs) and how do they rate the quality of education within these learning environments. One can ask how learning environments of the same kind (e.g., secondary schools, Kindergartens) differ, and how do their dif- ferences relate to individual development. A wealth of information is being provided on level of the learning environment. This includes structural and contextual characteristics and especially also features of the basic factor \u201corientation\u201d on the level of the school or Kindergarten.

Then, there is the decision about leaving school instead of continuing education, the choice between academic and vocational studies, and the question whether to attend vocational education and training or a tertiary track.

Thus, the interdependence between competence development (see Chap. 4, this volume), learning environments (see Chap. 5, this volume), and educational decisions has to be taken into account. Many studies have shown considerable inequality in the above-mentioned educational decisions. For instance, children with less favorable social backgrounds spend less time at Kindergarten (Becker and Lauterbach 2008), select less ambitious secondary school tracks (Ditton 2007), and are less likely to continue school after a first school leaving certificate (Tieben 2011). Furthermore, lower social origins lead to less participation in higher (Reimer and Pollak 2010) and adult education (Sch\u00f6mann and Becker 1995). The extent of educational attainment has serious consequences for peoples\u2019 life chances. More education leads to higher income (Boockmann and Steiner 2006) and a lower unemployment risk (Kettunen 1997).

According to Boudon (1974), the reasons for inequality in educational opportunity (IEO) can be divided into primary and secondary effects of social class. Whereas primary effects operate through class differences in educationally relevant competencies, secondary effects lead to class inequality in educational choices at the same level of academic compe- tence. Results for early educational stages prove that secondary effects are relatively strong in Germany (Becker 2009). Findings on the transition to secondary school in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate reveal that 53% of the effect of parental class and 71% of edu- cational origin are due to secondary effects (Stock\u00e9 2007a).

In the case of the transition to tertiary education, secondary effects have even been found to be as high as 53% and 79% (Neugebauer et al. 2013). Because secondary effects are of such pivotal significance for IEO, the third pillar deals with educational decisions. For younger birth cohorts, the gender gap in secondary school degrees has changed considerably. Today, female students even receive higher educational degrees in Germany (Diefenbach and Klein 2002) and are less susceptible to grade retention (Krohne and Meier 2004). At the same time, men and women still choose gender-specific school subjects, fields of study, vocational education and training programs, and appren- ticeships (e.g., Ayalon 1995).

Furthermore, this version of the theory has stimulated empirical research on selection between secondary school tracks and the decision to enter higher education (see, for a comparison of the different theories and the available empirical evidence, Stock\u00e9 2010). Thus, RCT is utilized as a theoretical basis of Pillar 3. Sociological RCT assumes that the summary evaluation of an educational option Oi can be represented as the subjective expected utility SEU (Oi) (Breen and Goldthorpe 1997; Erikson and Jonsson 1996; Esser 1999). This SEU value is based on different edu- cational returns that are evaluated on the basis of the actors\u2019 objectives j and result in the utility values Uij. Relevant objectives are labor market returns such as income, job security, and job prestige (Stock\u00e9 2007b).

Direct costs include financial expenditures for text- books, teaching materials, or tuition fees, whereas opportunity costs are all those forgone benefits that could have been realized instead of participating in educational training. The theory also includes nonfinancial burdens, for example, having to commute, time pressure, or alienation from friends and family. The theory assumes that the overall evaluation of each educational option can be expressed by the following formula: SEU (Oi) = pi \u2022 Uij \u2212 Cik.

Third, the expected utility of educational returns may differ, for instance, because of anticipated discrimination on the labor market or because higher certificates are unnec- essary for status maintenance. Theoretical approaches and empirical evidence suggest that decision mechanisms are often much less than perfectly instrumentally rational. Instead, they are assumed to reflect satisficing (Simon 1993), be affected by frame selection (Esser 2001), and result from utilizing heuristics (Gigerenzer and Todd 1999) and attitudes.

Within the widely acclaimed Wisconsin Model, these subcultural differences in beliefs and values are assumed to result from social influence processes (Sewell et al. 1970).

In contrast, ideal- istic aspirations entail either self-commitment or a normative expectation to reach a cer - tain educational level (see, for this differentiation, Haller 1968; Stock\u00e9 2005a). Whereas in many cases, it is unclear whether realistic expectations or idealistic wishes are being measured (e.g., Laanan 2003), idealistic aspirations are tapped more clearly by other measures (e.g., Dandy and Nettelbeck 2002).

In order to take the relative effect of reference persons into account, proxy information about the strength of ties has to be measured. Whereas the aforementioned influences establish normative reference group effects that are relevant for the formation of aspirations and values, reference groups also serve as a standard of comparison (Singer 1981).

Second, social capital encompasses differences in the quality and quantity of resources in a broader sense that a person can access and mobilize through social relations (Lin 1999). Three kinds of such resources can be dif- ferentiated. These are (a) information, for example, social networks provide access to adequate and cheap information about educational options (Granovetter 1973); (b) sup- port, for example, well-educated parents can offer their children more qualified help in school-related issues (Teachman et al. 1997); and (c) obligations, for example, social credit built up in the past may help the actor to find a well-paid job (Bourdieu 1986).

Basically, the authors assume that the class structure is reproduced across generations through the transmission of cultural capital within the family and through the way the cultural capital of the higher classes is rewarded within schools.

Applications of the theory of cultural reproduction follow two different views on cul- tural capital: public cultural participation that serves to communicate status distinctions versus private forms of activities\u2014such as reading\u2014that help to develop specific skills (Crook 1997; see also de Graaf et al. 2000).

In 2006, according to the school achievement studies PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) and PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), 26% of 4th-grade students and 19% of 15-year-olds had at least one parent who was born outside Germany (Schwippert et al. 2007; Walter and Taskinen 2007). These students have lower chances of attaining favorable educational and vocational qualifications. They are at a disadvantage with respect to the acquisition of knowledge and skills as well as with respect to their educational participation. In fact, the performance gap between migrant students and students from native-born families tends to be larger in Germany than in other OECD countries (Stanat and Christensen 2006). Given the"

Ethnic educational inequalities can be found throughout the school career. Children from migrant families already lag behind on qualifications when they start school (Becker and Biedinger 2006). They attend the highest, college-bound secondary track, the Gymnasium less often, and concentrate instead in the Hauptschule, the lowest track (Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2010). They also encounter difficulties in landing an apprenticeship in Germany\u2019s dual system of vocational training, and they differ from the majority population in the degrees eventually completed (Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2010).

Additional variation arises within groups when considering different indicators of school success. For example, students of Turkish ori- gin encounter considerable difficulties in terms of test scores in elementary and second- ary school (e.g., Kristen 2008; M\u00fcller and Stanat 2006), but given similar test results or grades, they outperform the majority at certain educational transitions (Kristen and Dollmann 2010; Kristen et al. 2008). Even though the description of these patterns has improved substantially over the past decade, we do not yet have a comprehensive picture of the educational careers of chil- dren of immigrants that not only captures different stages in the school system but also goes beyond the prominent immigrant\u2013majority distinction.

Most importantly, it seeks to uncover the origins of these inequalities. A crucial finding of previous research in this field is that the difficulties immigrants and their children face in the school system are largely the result of differences in edu- cational and social background (Alba et al. 1994; Heath et al. 2008; Kristen and Granato 2007; M\u00fcller and Stanat 2006; Segeritz et al. 2010). They are a matter of social rather than of specific ethnic inequalities (Kalter 2005). Therefore, an account of the emergence of these disparities has to refer to the social inequality mechanisms addressed in other NEPS pillars (e.g., Pillars 1 and 3; see Chaps. 4 and 6,"

Accordingly, NEPS Pillar 4 aims to dis- entangle the mechanisms that apply particularly to immigrants and their children and to assess their empirical relevance across the life course. In this chapter, we present the central considerations underlying NEPS Pillar 4 and, based on this account, highlight the pillar\u2019s analysis potential. In order to explain eth- nic inequalities in education, we start with the prominent distinction between primary and secondary effects (Boudon 1974) and apply this to students of immigrant origin (Sect. 7.2). We link this distinction with a general resources framework and adapt it for immigrants and their descendants. This leads to one of the most important debates within current integration research: that centering on the question whether the resources and opportunities available within the migrant group foster educational success."

The primary and secondary effects of ethnic origin thus capture those immigration-specific influences that persist after controlling for the effects of social origin. This distinction can be linked to a general resources framework according to which differences in the distribution of relevant resources or characteristics translate into a dif- ferential development of competencies as well as into distinct educational decisions. Depending on the resources available in the environment, the conditions for school suc- cess vary systematically.

Therefore, what matters is the quality of relations in terms of closeness, contact frequency, degree of kinship, or duration. In this regard again, strong ethnic networks can result in disadvantages for immigrants and their descendants: Among their weak, but especially among their strong ties, they find relatively few majority group members and many coethnics who may be less able to provide the information and support that is rel- evant for educational advancement in the country of residence (Haug and Pointner 2007; Gestring 2007). 130 C.

Against the background of this chapter, we high- light the pillar\u2019s analysis potential starting with some general remarks on the distinction between generations and migrant groups and then focusing on a selection of important constructs covered by Pillar 4. In line with the preceding sections, we pay special atten- tion to language proficiency and social networks."

        "text": "Complementing the description of ethnic educational inequalities across the life course and disentangling their origins requires the identification of different genera- tions and distinct immigrant groups, because the extent to which the above-mentioned arguments apply differs substantially. Pillar 4 implements a broad definition of genera- tion status based on the country of birth of the target person, the parents, and the grand- parents (e.g., Rumbaut 2004). This makes it possible to identify not only the first and second generation, but, in contrast to most other large-scale data sources, also the third generation. In addition, users of NEPS data can differentiate between more fine-grained combinations, for example, between individuals born to two foreign-born parents (i.e., the second generation), and those with only one parent born in Germany and the other born abroad (i.e., the so-called 2.5 generation). As illustrated in Sect. 7.3, an adequate assessment of language skills is crucial to Pil- lar 4."

In order to overcome the various methodological problems of previous studies, L1 profi- ciency in Russian and Turkish is being tested at three measurement points: in Grade 2 in order to assess L1 proficiency at an early stage of the educational career; in Grade 7 after the whole sample has transited into secondary school; and in Grade 9 shortly before the transition from school to work will take place for many students in the lower tracks of the school system. The tests focus on listening comprehension. We chose this focus because migrant students typically learn L1 in the family context and are not necessarily able to read or write in this language.

Listening compre- hension is tested with several multiple-choice questions per unit. In order to broaden the empirical basis for questions related to L1 proficiency, other aspects of L1 proficiency that are not tested (reading, writing, and speaking) are assessed as self-reports in all immigrant students and also at other stages of the educational process. NEPS is the first study in Germany to provide objective indicators of L1 proficiency for a representative sample of immigrant students. Moreover, the data are being gener - ated in a sample whose educational trajectories are followed up longitudinally, and for which a multitude of other"

In addition, the conditions of L1 acquisition and bilingualism in the family and in educational institutions can be examined more closely. NEPS will not be able to resolve all of the issues concerning the outcomes of L1 profi- ciency.

For each educational stage, social capital measurements include a resource generator that covers sources of information and support including the source\u2019s ethnic origin. For example, individuals are being asked whether they know someone who could help them to write an application or to gather information on job vacancies. In addition, a position generator is applied to examine the network\u2019s social and ethnic composition. For each accessible (social) position, we ask for the person\u2019s ethnic origin. Whereas for the early stages in the educational career, the focus is on parents\u2019 networks, attention shifts to the target persons\u2019 networks as they grow older.

Otherwise, one could argue that social capital effects are a mere artifact of unobserved heterogeneity (Kalter 2010) or a result of the homophilious formation of friendship net- works (Mouw 2006). 132 C.

Other important behavioral manifestations include mating behavior and cultural habits\u2014for example, the celebration of country-specific holidays or cooking habits. These measures always cover the orientation toward both the country of origin and the country of residence. Regarding cultural capital, we complement the instruments of Pillar 3 (see Chap. 6, this volume) with immigrant-specific aspects.

For example, the endogeneity bias represents a serious obstacle for estimating returns to education with respect to health outcomes: The question is whether persons are healthier due to a higher level of education, or whether more healthy persons have better access to educational resources. Nonmarket returns to education are more important for earlier stages in the educational career. A further question is how far early acquired competencies facilitate additional learning.

Formal education has been shown to have a causal effect on reducing weight (Atella and Kopinska 2014). Nutrition has an impact on body weight that is important with respect to cardiovascular diseases or arthropathy.

In addition, physical activities, especially performed in groups or sport clubs, are also seen as a learning environment, and therefore belong to Pillar 2 (see Chap. 5, this volume). The use of medical care depends on education, income, and socioeconomic status even in countries in which health insurance covers most expenses for almost all people. Several important indicators of health in early childhood correlate with the social status of parents. This is especially important in early childhood when medical care is a sub- stantial need, especially for newborns, and health shortcomings can have a major impact on early child development. Moreover, serious complications at birth (e.g., prematurity) may cause long lasting delays in child development that are detrimental to learning pro- cesses.

Furthermore, selection processes could take place when educational outcomes, labor market participation, or (downward) social mobility are influenced by health status. This may lead to an endogeneity bias when the returns of education on health are estimated. Thus, there are reasons to consider both causal paths: The first path treats health as one dimension of nonmonetary returns to education, and the reversed causal path argues that educational outcomes themselves are influenced by the health status (e.g., disabilities or mental health) during school (see, e.g., Jungbauer-Gans and Gross 2009). The use of panel data could shed some light on whether one of these paths is more important than the other. Whenever we survey children and adolescents, we also have to control for their socioe- conomic status, the education of their parents, and their migration background (Wadsworth and Bartley 2006).

This may trigger disadvantages even when the physician\u2019s time is distributed equally between all patients (Balsa and McGuire 2001). Another important issue is how far cognitive competencies as well as knowledge about health and medicine mediate between education and health status or health behav- ior. Therefore, the application of scientific knowledge on issues of health evaluated in Pillar 1 (see Chap. 4, this volume) can be used to assess the meaning of knowledge for health outcomes in a straightforward manner.

However, they warn against focusing on cognitive abilities alone by showing a causal effect of personality traits on health and healthy behaviors in later life. Health in general is a multidimensional construct that includes physical, emotional, men- tal, social, and behavior-related dimensions of well-being and productivity (Schumacher et al. 2003). Measurements of health without using laboratory data and medical records have been shown to have high predictive validity even when mortality is considered (Idler and Benyamini 1997; Schwarze et al. 2000).

Economic theory assumes that utility is a function of income, leisure, and probably of health. Education enters this function only indirectly as a productivity- and health-enhancing factor. However, an interesting question in this con- text is whether education has a genuine direct impact on well-being. A direct test of such a hypothesis would require an econometric model in which life satisfaction is regressed on education and earnings, health, leisure, and other control variables. Nowadays, there"

The direc- tion of causality between education and satisfaction is still unclear. Heckman (1976), for example, enters the human capital stock into the utility function multiplicatively in connection with leisure, assuming that education leads to a more efficient use of leisure. Thus, education is expected to have a positive impact on life satisfaction. However, if satisfaction measures something like optimism, and if"

In addition, overeducation may also cause dissatisfaction. Because these losses of utility cannot be compensated by a reasonable wage increase at the start of the first employment, overeducation is mostly involuntary and enhances pro- ductivity costs. However, negative consequences of overeducation diminish with profes- sional experience (Verhaest and Omey 2009). In summary, empirical analyses of the satisfaction\u2013education nexus have to be car - ried out cautiously due to problems of endogeneity, selection bias, and omitted variables.

Although a broad body of literature supports the strong association between educational attainment and political participation, a causal link is questionable in the light of current research (Berinsky and Lenz 2011; Mayer 2011).

For the educa- tional system as a marriage market, this means that the likelihood of finding a partner of the opposite sex with a homogeneous educational level has also enlarged across cohorts (Blossfeld and Timm 2003). Several studies have shown a strong inverse relationship between fertility and education for women in postindustrial societies. Better educated women and men are older at the time of the birth of their first child than less educated women and men.

The National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) raises some challenges connected with these concepts. The concepts to be included in the design (see Chap. 1, this volume) have to be selected carefully. Different facets of motivational concepts (in the broadest sense) and personality can be consid- ered when investigating educational processes and the development of competencies.

A number of motivational and personality factors can be disentangled within the framework of educational processes and competence development. Some of these are quite stable; others are more variable and situation-adaptive. When selecting concepts to be included in NEPS, we integrated the different research traditions and interests of psy- chologists, educational scientists, sociologists, and economists. Although motivational concepts and personality aspects relate substantially to each of the other five central NEPS dimensions (see Chaps. 4\u20138, this volume), this topic constitutes its own research field within NEPS.

For NEPS, we selected some common main components of multiple theoretical perspec- tives in order to guarantee a wide variety of possible uses of these concepts in different disciplines. This also makes it possible to compare different theories and untangle how they relate to each other. Among both psychologists and educational scientists, one of the currently most popular motivational theories is expectancy-value theory from Wigfield and Eccles (2000). 157 9 Measuring Motivational Concepts \u2026 This theory posits that decisions are based on a set of influences: on the one hand, ability beliefs defined as \u201cthe individual\u2019s perception of his or her current"

These two basic components are then combined with different task-value components (see Wigfield and Eccles 2000): attainment value (how important succeeding in this activity is to the individual), intrinsic value (how much joy the individual gets from performing the task or how much interest the individual has in it), utility value (how well a task corresponds to short- and long-term goals), and cost (the negative aspects that emerge when performing an activity). Other models (e.g., Bandura 1997; Hidi et al. 2004) include different contrib- utory factors such as ability or academic self-concepts, interests, and achievement goals.

During the stage of adulthood, we intended to implement a measure on learning motivation in the context of further education and advanced training. In addition to learning motivation, students\u2019 effort is being assessed in Starting Cohorts 3 and 4, because part of the shock caused by PISA was a lack (or at least insuf- ficient amount) of students\u2019 effort besides other factors such as school quality.

Suitable scales are, on the one hand, an adaptation of the work aspirations instrument used in the TOSCA study (Transformations of the Secondary School System and Academic Careers; cf. K\u00f6ller 2004) and, on the other hand, the desired work conditions instrument from the MOW International Research Team (1987).

People especially select environments that are congruent to their interests and they change (or leave) incongruent environments. In order to measure RIASEC interests, NEPS has developed a new instrument (IILS; Interest Inventory Life Span, with a child and an adult version). It is based on the fol- lowing inventories: (a) a German (30-item) version of the Inventory of Children\u2019s Activities\u2013Revised (ICA-R) from Tracey and Ward (1998), German version ICA-D from von Maurice (2006) that has been developed and tested for elementary school age 160 F.

Item selection was based on empirical analyses and plausibility checks. Consequently, a very short 18-item instrument for measuring the six Holland-scales R, I, A, S, E and C is available in both versions.

This approach is insufficient for NEPS, because it is following individual development over the entire life span. After students have left school, subject-specific measurement seems rewarding only when another school-similar context follows that is also arranged in subjects (e.g., university). Hence, it is advisa- ble to avoid gathering this information in a school-subject-oriented way (subject-related interest; German term \u2018Fachinteresse\u2019), but to use a different approach and ask for more general interest fields independently from school subjects (see Daniels 2008). Focusing on topic-related interests (German term \u2018Sachinteresse\u2019) enables us to use the same instrument across school stages as well as after finishing school. This makes it possible to analyze topic-related interests over different stages (see Chap. 1, this volume). Simi- larly, NEPS Pillar 1"

In analogy to this characteristic, the measuring of interest should include at least the two domains German and mathematics in order to allow research on the interdependence of interests, other motivational components, and school achievement. For this reason, we capture topic- related interests in the two domains German and mathematics. Using items taken from a study by Baumert et al.

And finally, there is the domain of working people, whose environment is no longer arranged in an explicit structure with regard to contents (though it should be noted that occu- pational environments can be described in terms of the RIASEC model, especially in comparison to general interest orientations, thus allowing us to examine, e.g., vocational decisions or person\u2013environment fit). Therefore, it seems a challenging task to measure the self-concept across all stages in an identical way. However, because the self-concept is characterized by a hierarchical structure (see, e.g., Lichtlein 2000; Marsh 1987; Marsh and Shavelson 1985; Shavelson et al. 1976), it is possible to realize a consistent capture as well as a differentiating measure of the theoretical construct\u2014as the following section will show. 9.4.1 General Self-Concept The hierarchy of the self-concept provides a particularly convenient possibility of dif- ferentiating measurement throughout NEPS: Across the life course, the general self-"

This pro- vides the advantage of being able to compare different age groups to each other and monitor the development and stability of the general dimension of self-concept through- out the life course. Among the conceivable measures, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg 1965) seems to fulfill the requirements, because self-esteem forms the main element of self- concept (see Ferring and Filipp 1996). Concretely, our choice from among the available German instruments was the revised Self- Esteem Scale from von Collani and Herzberg (2003a). As in the original version by Rosenberg (1965), this scale includes positive as 162 F.

Furthermore, the scale is very economical with only 10 items, thus meeting the needs of a large-scale survey study such as NEPS. 9.4.2 Domain-Specific Self-Concept At the school stages, measurement of the domain-specific self-concept is geared to the PISA 2000 study that had gathered three subdimensions: overall academic self-concept, verbal self-concept, and mathematical self-concept (see Kunter et al. 2002). This entirely matches the specific structure of the school stages as well as the typical hierarchy in school. Furthermore, every subdimension consists of only three items. Therefore, the instrument perfectly suits the needs of NEPS and is being applied in the school stages. In addition to self-concept, we measure helplessness. The notion of helplessness goes back to Abramson et al. (1978) and was adapted in a study by Ditton (2007). In analogy to its use there, we integrated the measure of helplessness separately into"

(2002) by using their absolute academic self-concept scale, whereas helplessness is geared to Jerusalem and Schwarzer\u2019s (2006) study-specific helplessness. 9.5 Personality Alongside the dimensions of motivation, personal goals, interests, and self-concept, another element is of major importance: an individual\u2019s personality. By measuring per - sonality characteristics starting at a very young age and continuing up to adulthood, it should be possible to identify not only developmental risks but also protective factors against just these risks (Weinert et al. 2007). In psychological research, a widespread model with a very long tradition is the five factor model (FFM) of personality that can be recovered in"

For younger children, parents\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 evaluation of the child\u2019s temperament can lead to a better understanding of personality development and its relation to educa- tional processes, because personality emerges out of early temperament in conjunction with the learning environment (Bayer et al. 2015; Putnam and Rothbart 2006).

Socially competent behavior is of central importance for denoting risks of nega- tive behavior development (see Beelmann et al. 2006; Weinert et al. 2007). Capturing social skills in general is a challenging task, because many different instruments are available. Extensive scales focusing on as many distinct facets as possible are not suit- able within the framework of a panel study. Therefore, a slightly narrowed perspective seemed appropriate. Here, we concentrate on some subdomains of social behavior and thereby focus on behavioral attributes. A popular instrument for measuring such social skills is Goodman\u2019s (1997, 1999) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The SDQ \u201cprovides balanced coverage of children and young people\u2019s behaviours, emotions, and relationships\u201d (Goodman 1997, p. 581), and consists of five"

However, in mixed-mode designs, the coherent construct measurement across different assessment conditions is frequently questionable. From survey research it is known that the trade-off between benefits and costs accom- panying mixed-mode designs requires comparability studies and studies that investigate hypotheses about the potential causes of differences between assessment conditions (e.g., J\u00e4ckle et al. 2010).

UOA also differs from traditional paper-and-pencil tests in terms of the mode (CBA vs. PBA). The mode is understood as a combination of multiple properties of an assess- ment, such as the medium, the input device, the format (portrait vs. landscape), possible feedback on the number of missing items, and other properties (see Kroehne and Mar - tens 2011).

Human supervision can be achieved to some extent in so-called online proctored testing (Rios and Liu 2017). In open mode and controlled mode, there is no guarantee that only the designated test taker answers the test. A third person, such as a more capable conspirator, can influence the answers gat- hered in UOA. Moreover, test takers might use additional materials that are either unaut- horized or at least not available under standardized testing conditions (e.g., Bloemers et al. 2016).

A possible approach to reduce this heterogeneity is the formulation of restrictive inclusion criteria (i.e., require- ments concerning the devices allowed or the browsers supported for a particular study). Consequently, online assessments might require prerequisites (such as a desktop com- puter with minimal display size and Internet access) that might either exclude some test takers from participation (International Test Commission 2006) or, at least, impose an additional burden on them.

A combination used in one particular wave in NEPS is the mixture of CAPI for one random subsample of the cohort and a combination of CATI and UOA for the remaining subsample. The mixture of CATI and UOA incorporates two selection pro- cesses: participating in the CATI first followed by the decision to participate in the UOA. Taking both together, the sample composition for the assessment part of interest (i.e., the competence test administered in the CAPI and UOA delivery) is the result of two different selection processes that might best be described as one measurement point (CAPI) versus two measurement points (CATI and UOA).

Response times also allows defining dropout at the item level as the number of not answered items after the last answered item when the time limit for a domain has not been reached.

Within each setting, specific characteristics of the test-taking behavior are possible, and one test setting is not necessarily superior to anot- her. Accordingly, unfiltered data could be used independently for the subsamples created by the randomly assigned or self-selected test delivery (standardized vs. online). Howe- ver, as soon as ability estimates are to be used interchangeably, effects of the mode and setting should be taken into account. Within each setting, for instance, within group testing sessions at universities, ran- dom assignment of test takers to modes can justify the assumption of random equiva- lent groups (Buerger et al. 2016). As discussed in this chapter, the treatment of mode effects cannot be adapted"

In particular, when a test-taking behavior (such as short inter - ruptions) is observed only in one setting, strong assumptions would be required (extra- polation). In this chapter, we generalize the idea of motivation filtering (Wise et al. 2004) as a first step before a potential treatment of mode effects. Filtering in this first step is expec- ted to be most effective if implemented as liberally as possible. After controlling for dif- ferences in test-taking behavior, remaining differences in the sample composition can be corrected if necessary, for instance, by using weighting or matching techniques. Filtering regarding test-taking behavior and possibly the additional adjustment for the sample composition result in groups that can be assumed to be equal concerning their competence. Subsequently, measurement invariance can be investigated, and at least construct equivalence should be established. Finally,"

The idea of generalizing the filtering approach, known for motivation filtering in low-stakes assessments, was a response to two main challenges: concerns about the validity of online assessments (lurking, rapid guessing, inattentive responding, use of additional material) and the need for an argu- ment for creating random equivalent groups as the prerequisite for dealing with psycho- metric differences between settings. 188 U.

As illustrated with selected examples, hints for different test-taking behaviors can be found in additional data about the processes by which the survey and test data were collected (paradata). Accordingly, as soon as paradata are used to exclude cases (i.e., filtering), procedures for cleaning and validating paradata would be required to ensure data quality. Moreover, to foster the reproducibility of analyses and results, strategies for disseminating the information used from paradata should be developed that balance between the effort to create scientific use files (e.g., including indicators derived from paradata) and the research potential (e.g., the possibility of investigating new indica- tors).

Providing raw log data rests not only on the availability of resources to anonymize and document them, but also on the tools that can be used by substantive researchers to analyze these kinds of data (such as the PIAAC Log- Data Analyzer, Goldhammer et al. 2017). Given both prerequisites, providing access to raw log data might be desira- ble because it would particularly make it possible to investigate methodological research questions such as the effect of technical problems and re-logins (e.g., Sinharay et al. 2014) on online assessments.

Further research will be necessary as soon as ability estimates from different compu- terizations of instruments are compared (see, e.g., Bennett 2003), for instance, across cohorts. The extension described in this chapter provides a framework for dealing with low-stakes UOA. This includes studies conducted for instrument development. As Barry and Finney (2009) showed by comparing UOA and different standardizations of class- room testing, standardized test conditions are superior even for test development. A major limitation of the described strategy to deal with UOA is that it focuses only on the psychometric modeling of mode effects after treating the potential confounding due to setting-specific test-taking behavior with filtering.

Because the reference test setting might be the result of setting-spe- cific selection behaviors as well, measures of representativeness, such as r indicators (Schouten et al. 2009, Shlomo et al. 2012), could be used to balance selection effects concerning the derivation of cutoff values.

Competencies measured in school-age and adulthood cannot simply be transferred to early childhood, because competencies develop dynamically over the life- span (see Weinert 2007).

Briefly, visual habituation is viewed as a manifestation of encoding speed, whereas dishabituation is taken to be the ability to differentiate the habituation stimulus from a new stimulus. These mental functions are interpreted as forms of information processing\u2014that is, the speed, exactness, and com- pleteness of the encoding along with the memorization, recognition, and comparison to a new and different stimulus (Bornstein and Sigman 1986; Fagan et al. 2007; Fagan and McGrath 1981; Kav\u0161ek 2004; McCall and Carriger 1993).

All these studies support the notion that there is continuity between infants\u2019 information processing abili- ties and later measurements of intelligence. Moreover, if stimuli are chosen that represent a certain amount of objects or members of a specific category, it may even be possible to gain insight into possibly domain-spe- cific early number processing or categorization processes.

The challenge of the newborn cohort study in NEPS is to transfer this experimental paradigm to the home setting, because all children are visited and observed at home (see Sect. 11.4 for the pro- cedure). To face these challenges, extensive feasibility studies were conducted to develop a habituation paradigm that can be applied in a large-scale study in a home setting. After this pilot phase the habituation paradigm was applied in the first two waves of the NEPS newborn cohort study when the children were 7 and 17 months, respectively (Weinert et al. 2016).

In the preverbal phase, important precursor skills for language development are turn-taking skills and the reception and production of typical prosodic shapes (Hennon et al. 2000; Mampe et al. 2009). From 9 months onward, infants build up joint attention and receptive vocabulary. The amount of joint attention episodes in the communication between infant and parents correlates with later language development (Bornstein et al. 1999). Possible methods for assessing these preverbal competencies are the observation of turn-taking and joint attention in (semistructured) parent\u2013child interactions.

We also survey the structure and aspects of the quality of Kindergarten and elementary school, families, and nonformal learning environments.

        "text": "Importance of Early Education and Elementary School Early childhood is a period of extensive development in various cognitive and noncogni- tive domains\u2014as emphasized by different research traditions in education science, psy- chology, and biology. Despite ongoing debates on the relative importance of either nature or nurture, there is abundant evidence for the influence of not only individual charac- teristics and preconditions but also environmental features on children\u2019s developmental progress and outcomes (e.g., Brooks-Gunn and Markman 2005; Silbereisen and Noak 2006). Ecological theories of development point out how development is influenced by the different environments children live and participate in (e.g., Bronfenbrenner and Ceci 1994; Marjoribanks 2002). A related major issue in educational research and cur - rent politics concerns the effect of the quantity and quality of early nonparental care and education on the development of children and the reconciliation between family life and parental"

Early disparities in skills, competen- cies, and educational pathways are observable ahead of school enrollment and during 217 12 Kindergarten and Elementary School: Starting \u2026 elementary school and\u2014again\u2014there are strong expectations that nonfamilial care and education settings will make a special contribution to compensating for early disparities (e.g., Ro\u00dfbach 2004). However, to gain more insight into the mechanisms generating differences in achievement, it is necessary to take a longitudinal perspective.

Major topics are (a) the development of competencies and educational careers in Kindergarten and elementary school age; (b) Kindergarten, elementary school, and family as learning environments; (c) the transition from Kin- dergarten to elementary school and from elementary to secondary school and the accom- panying decisions on education; (d) the extent and the significance of social and ethnic disparities in children\u2019s early"

In particular, NEPS data are delivering new findings on the net effects of fam- ily characteristics, Kindergarten, and elementary school on the development of compe- tencies over time. When it comes to learning environments, researchers have the opportunity to gain a detailed picture of what institutional and familial learning environments look like in Ger - many. It is possible to examine the impact of learning environments at home, in Kinder - garten, and in elementary school on various educational outcomes, and how these relate to questions of inequality of educational opportunity (IEO). What characteristics of home environments and parents\u2019 activities are the most important mediators of early pri- mary effects of stratification (Boudon 1974)? This also targets the question whether and to what extent different forms of cultural capital can be seen as causal factors influencing educational outcomes. Alongside social class differences, it is"

Educational decisions, also known as secondary effects of stratification (Boudon 1974), are of great importance in the German education system (Maaz and Nagy 2009). One of the most important transitions in the German education systems takes place at the end of elementary school when children are normally 9 to 10 years old. By exploiting NEPS data, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of why parents in Germany pick a particular secondary school and how this relates to social class or ethnic group. Regarding ethnic inequality, the data are useful for describing and analyzing dispari- ties during elementary school. The effect of educational participation, ethnic capital, and orientations on the development of competencies and on parents\u2019 school decisions can be analyzed. In addition, with respect to students with a non-German language background, 226 K."

Stage 4 follows the target persons through the course of secondary school up to their transitions to higher secondary education, vocational education and training, or direct entry into the labor market. In most German federal states, students enter secondary edu- cation after Grade 4. They choose between different tracks or types of school, mainly between the school types of Hauptschule, Realschule, Schule mit mehreren Bildungs- g\u00e4ngen, Gesamtschule, and Gymnasium. Throughout lower secondary education, stu- dents can move upward or downward between school tracks, mainly depending on their school performance."

Pillar 4 inquires more deeply into the migration history and background with questions about the three past generations. Beyond that, students with a native language other than German are asked specific questions to find out how they assess their knowledge and competencies in their first and second language and which languages they use in different situations (see Chap. 7, this volume).

Factors of spe- cial interest are those that lead to educational decisions in the tradition of rational choice theory. Hence, students are asked, for example, whether they think that they can attain different educational degrees and what kind of benefits and costs they associate with dif- ferent educational degrees.

This concept emphasizes the development and the functional-pragmatic contextualization of specific competence domains in terms of different environments in which they are acquired (e.g., UNESCO 2004).

Linguistic findings on graphema- tics have changed the view on orthography and orthography instruction in recent years (Eisenberg 1995; Eisenberg and Fuhrhop 2007). These have shown that the aspect of norm fulfillment ceases to be of primary importance. In turn, the relation of orthography to other linguistic competencies is outlined. Learning orthography promotes linguistic awareness as well as reading competence and text competence (Blatt 2010; Hinney 1997; Schneider et al. 2008).

Such constructs and other personal traits are also considered in the general assessment framework of NEPS (see for further information, Chap. 9, this volume).

Although the NEPS research instrument is very broad, these guid- ing questions are central for its development. In addition to the panel study, Stage 5 is implementing two supplementary studies to reflect changes due to reforms of the Gymnasium and their consequences for the interpretation of NEPS longitudinal data. One study focuses on the organizational reform in Thuringia; the other on the reduction in the number of years of schooling for the Abitur (G8 reform) in Baden- Wuerttemberg. Both studies are described in some detail. The chapter closes with a short summary of the valuable contributions of NEPS in Stage 5.

This access to higher education has been broadened over the last decades, with several alter - native routes leading to the necessary certificates. However, the highest and most attrac- tive school-leaving certificate is still the Abitur that provides access to the greatest range of higher education. In fact, the Abitur occupies the central"

The majority of young adults acquire their Abitur at the upper secondary level of a Gymnasium. Consequently, the main focus of this chapter is on this institution. The organization of the upper secondary academic track education, the curriculum to be implemented, and the characteristics of the upper secondary school-leaving certifi- cate, the Abitur, have always played a major role in scientific, political, and public dis- cussions about the school system. Because it opens up access to a highly attractive range of careers for a selected group of students, the upper secondary academic track educa- tion and the Abitur have been the subject of several long-standing political and scien- tific debates (Baumert et al. 2003; Huber 2004; K\u00f6ller et al. 2004; Trautwein et al. 2007, 2010a; Trautwein and Neumann 2008).

How predictive are achievement levels at the Abitur for later success at university and in the job market? Before the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), there had been no systematic nationwide empirical monitoring and evaluation of the upper secondary level that would give scientifically sound answers to these and other questions. The German Gymnasium recently underwent two important transformations (see Trautwein and Neumann 2008). First, many states have reformed the curriculum and organization of upper secondary schooling with the aim of increasing the common knowledge basis for all students. The reforms have brought a substantial reduction of choice options (e.g., advanced course choices) with the aim of homogenizing the cur - riculum experienced"

Such reforms may cause cohort effects in outcomes and students\u2019 educational biographies and are thus highly relevant for NEPS. However, it should be mentioned that several states have now revoked or eased this reform (see H\u00fcbner et al. 2017). In the present chapter, we give an overview of the work in so-called Stage 5 of NEPS and its linkage to the NEPS pillars and the adjacent stages (for the framing concept of NEPS see Chap. 1, this volume). We begin in Sect. 14.2 with an overview of empirical 256 W. Wagner et al. studies on the upper secondary level that were already available before NEPS started.

Using standardized achievement tests in several school subjects, they provided unprecedented insights into individual development and the trajectories of achievement in different school types. For instance, with regard to the upper second- ary level, there were large differences between different school types: Students in Gesa- mtschule, Aufbaugymnasium (a special school type leading to Abitur for students from Realschule), and Wirtschaftsgymnasium (upper secondary vocational school of econom- ics) scored considerably lower on the mathematical literacy and advanced mathematics tests compared to students in the traditional Gymnasium and the Technisches Gymna- sium (Gymnasium with a technical focus).

There is consensus in educational and social structure research that social inequality in educational participation emerges primarily at points of transition in the education system (Breen and Goldthorpe 1997; Schnabel et al. 2002). These transitions reflect the cumulative effects of previous edu- cational decisions: the earlier educational choices have to be made, the more sustained the effects of social disparities (Shavit and Blossfeld 1993); the later in the educational career these decisions are made, the weaker the effects of social disparities (Mayer et al. 2007).

Drawing on data from a subsample of participants in the TOSCA study, a decision model was specified for the analysis of secondary background effects, and the transition to higher education was analyzed from a longitudinal perspective. Thereby, the effects of social background were found to be mediated by the indicators of the decision model. Based on the rational choice framework of Erikson and Jonsson (1996), Schindler and Reimer (2010) modeled secondary effects of social background at the transition to higher education in terms of perceived costs, returns, and success probability. Using the nonlin- ear effect decomposition proposed by Fairlie (2005), they quantified the extent to which grade of Abitur (primary effect) and motives of postsecondary career path (secondary effect) can explain the transition gap between students from service classes and students with a working class background.

Concerning the latter, the so-called dual system of vocational training (appren- ticeship in a firm plus partly general and partly occupation-specific theoretical educa- tion in vocational schools) has attracted much attention in international debates and research. The dual system has been seen as one of the skill formation systems capable of not only reconciling high wages with high productivity via high skills and high value- added production, but also of integrating less-educated youths into enhancing skill for - mation processes (Culpepper and Finegold 1999; Culpepper and Thelen 2008; Streeck 1989).

The dual system has often been portrayed incorrectly as the only form of VET in Germany (e.g., Shackleton 1995). In fact, the German VET system features a number of different tracks or educational pathways. Besides the firm-based dual system, there are school-based VET programs; and both firm and school-based programs lead to nation- ally recognized occupation-specific VET certificates. The dual system trains youth for manufacturing and industry occupations and some of the white-collar occupations (such as commercial, retail, and administrative occupations), whereas full-time school-based VET programs prepare trainees for personal service occupations (such as nurses, mid- wives, medium-level care professionals, Kindergarten teachers, and social workers)"

The various VET programs are quite diverse in terms of the skill level to be achieved. They range from comparatively simple manual and retail occupations (e.g., bricklayer, painter, or shop assistant) to rather complex white-collar occupations in banking, insurance, 280 W.

In addition, previous issues such as underinvestment in higher education, increasing heterogeneity of student populations, and the link between higher education and work continued to be a major concern for higher education policy and management (Mayer 2008; Liebeskind in press). At the same time, empirical research lacked a comprehensive nationwide microdata base for analyzing higher education, its prerequisites, relevant decisions, and short- and long-term outcomes from a life-course perspective. Available data were restricted to par - ticular transitions and stages within the higher education system without focusing on either competencies, learning environments, or the first years in the labor market. Panel data projects were restricted to particular Federal States, institutions, or fields of study. In addition to the lack of comprehensive data sources, little was known about the learning environments in HEIs and their impact on competence formation and higher education"

Data collection in the NEPS Starting Cohort First-Year Students aimed to fill these gaps and thus pave the way for empirical research on the above-mentioned questions. The guiding research questions for setting up the sampling and data collection in the higher education stage centered on the overall issues in NEPS: competence acquisition and development in formal and nonformal/informal learning environments, educational decisions and transitions alongside"

The Starting Cohort First-Year Students placed a special emphasis on developing a questionnaire to adequately measure learn- ing environments in higher education (see Schaeper and Wei\u00df 2016) and on developing a subject-specific competence test (see Lauterbach 2015). Both developments consti- tuted an important novelty in higher education research: Hitherto, the implementation of items concerning learning environments at German HEIs was rare and lacked a coher - ent theoretical base. Subject-specific competence assessment across a broad variety of HEIs was completely new to higher education surveys in Germany. Unstandardized study programs and heterogeneous curricula even in study programs with identical names severely impeded the development of universally applicable test instruments (Zlatkin- Troitschanskaia et al. 2015). In cooperation with the WiwiKom project (see F\u00f6rster et al. 2013), we made a first attempt to"

First, it is crucial to control the setting of the test situation to ensure comparability with test results from an interviewer-supported test scenario. Comparability depends to a large extent on a calm and undisturbed test situation and on the proper and controlled display of the test items. In line with this, participants in the web-based testing were asked to use a traditional computer or a laptop/notebook to complete the tests.

Second, the logging of the testing process is more important in web-based testing than in web-based interviewing. Detailed logging of web-based test completion is particularly important in mixed-mode test studies, because the adequate linking of test results requires information on the process of test comple- tion when interviewer surveillance is lacking.

According to Hussey and Smith (2010, p. 156), \u201ca transition is a significant change in a student\u2019s life, self-concept and learning: a shift from one state of understanding, devel- opment and maturity to another.\u201d On the one hand, HEIs and labor market players can support these transitions and make them as easy as possible; on the other hand, transi- tions such as student dropout should be avoided."

This discussion is motivated by ongoing globalization, skill- biased technological change, digitalization, and the development of a knowledge soci- ety. As these structural changes are of crucial importance for the working lives of the population in (post-) industrialized countries, education is no longer an asset achieved in youth that remains of constant value during a long and stable employment career. Today, adults have to learn continuously to keep up with flexible requirements at the workplace and to be able to find employment in different and rapidly changing fields. Additionally, because the aging population in Germany is leading to a lack of skilled employees, life- long learning becomes more"

The third objective of the NEPS adult stage is to collect data on domain-specific and domain-general cognitive competencies during adulthood.

Life courses are influenced by institutions in which individuals are embedded. Thus, life courses depend partly on individual decisions and intentional behavior and partly on unintentional outcomes of the individual\u2019s actions (for applications, see, e.g., B\u00e4chmann and Gatermann 2017; H\u00e4gglund and B\u00e4chmann 2017).

The questionnaire is also based on concepts that capture salient historical changes in life-course patterns. The most comprehensive approach, individualization theory (Beck 1986), assumes that individuals are gaining greater control over their lives due to the process of modernization. Accordingly, they pursue a wider variety of life choices and life trajectories. This concept can be contrasted to various other, partly contradicting approaches to life course development such as pluralization (Zapf 1991), institutionaliza- tion (Kohli 1985), deinstitutionalization (Shanahan 2000), standardization (Kohli 1985), and destandardization (Modell et al. 1976).

Several changes in life-course patterns are already apparent. For example, the notion of \u201cstandard biographies\u201d has lost empirical relevance (Buchmann 1989; Heinz 2003; Mayer et al. 2010). The traditional sequence of life stages\u2014from education to work and from work to retirement\u2014is gradually being expanded by more diverse patterns: Individ- uals may reenter education after periods of work, take sabbaticals, change occupations during their careers, or combine work and other activities in prolonged transitions into retirement (Jacob 2004).

Therefore, an important open question is how basic competencies develop during adolescence and adulthood and how they influence the acquisition of domain-specific competencies in later life stages.

Therefore, the NEPS adult stage collects information on informal educational activities in a standardized way.

This first selection criterion is especially difficult with regard to the highly heterogeneous target group covered in the NEPS adult stage.

In NEPS Wave 3 (2011), the entire sample was refreshed again. In order to test domain-specific and domain-general competencies in the adult pop- ulation, respondents are tested in one or two competence domains at regular intervals through self-administered tests. During these test waves, the respondent\u2019s life course since the last interview is updated and some additional short questions from other NEPS pillars are asked. Usually an interviewer visits the respondents in their homes, conducts the assessments, and carries out the computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). In waves in which no tests are administered, the life-course information is updated and questions provided by the pillars and the NEPS adult stage are surveyed. In these waves, the default mode is a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI). Overall, the survey modes"

When a telephone num- ber is missing for a member of the sample, the individual is visited by interviewers in their home to ask about telephone numbers. If a respondent refuses to participate on the phone, a CAPI interview is conducted. Likewise, if a respondent refuses to welcome an interviewer into their home, a CATI interview is offered and the competence assessment is waived. Thus, a deliberate CATI/CAPI mix is offered in order to minimize nonre- sponse bias and panel attrition. The interviews last about 30 min when combined with competence assessments and at most 60 min in waves without assessments. The length of the competence tests varies between 30 and 60 min. 17.3.2 Questionnaire Design Regardless of the survey mode, the interviews in the NEPS adult stage are always com- puter-assisted. Computer-assisted interviews provide numerous opportunities to enhance data quality and to conduct customized interviews due to almost unlimited filtering pos- sibilities. The NEPS"

Because a significant part of the yearly interviews is devoted to collecting or updating life-course information, the most important feature used is that of technical innovations in life-course instruments. To receive reliable and valid information, all subareas of the life course are recorded in independent longitudinal modules of schooling, vocational preparation, vocational training and higher education, military service, employment history, unemployment history, partners in the household, children, and parental leave. Thus, we explicitly allow for parallel episodes. This modu- lar design guarantees adequate reporting of the entire life course in all its complexity. Three technical strategies are combined to assist the respondents in remembering and anchoring their activities throughout time: First, interviewers can access informa- tion respondents had already given earlier in the interview to help them"

Second, after the initial data collection, the consistency of dates across all modules is checked in a special data revision module. This consistency check is made by the interviewers with the help of special software during the interview, so that mistakes and problems can be corrected immediately with the help of the respond- ents. This step integrates immediate data editing into the survey, so that any inconsisten- cies that emerge can be clarified together with the respondents. These measures improve overall data quality and validity (Ruland et al. 2016). Other successful implementations of this design\u2014for example, the German Life History Study (Hillmert et al. 2004) and the forerunner study of the NEPS adult stage, Working and Learning in a Changing World (ALWA) (Antoni et al. 2010; Kleinert et al. 2011)\u2014have shown that the quality"

Third, Proactive Dependent Interviewing tech- niques are applied to collect life-course data as completely and consistently as possible (Trahms et al. 2016). Preloads are used to remind respondents of their answers from previous interviews, for example, on their employment or on their partner and children. These preloads are used primarily as cues to continue one or more episodes from one panel wave to the next. 17.4 Conclusion This short overview has hopefully sparked the reader\u2019s interest in the theoretical approaches of the NEPS adult stage, the data generated within NEPS Starting Cohort 6, and the empirical studies that have analyzed these data so far. The three main objectives of Stage 8 are to provide rich data from a life-course perspective on adult education, on competencies, and on labor market and non-labor-market-related returns to educa- tional investments.

Furthermore, the design of the NEPS adult stage allows for the assessment of long-term developments because life-course data have been collected for a large range of birth cohorts. Thus, the data collection program provides detailed high- quality information on numerous aspects of the educational and employment trajectories and the transition between different stages of the life course and for specific population groups. This has already generated numerous empirical results and will certainly con- tinue to do so in the future. 342 J. Allmendinger et al. References Aisenbrey, S., & Fasang, A. (2017).

Up to and including 2017, the NEPS bibliography lists almost 250 empirical articles in academic journals, edited vol- umes, and monographs. This number underestimates the actual output, because not all users reliably inform LIfBi about their publications and, despite intense monitoring by LIfBi, not all relevant articles might therefore have been identified. Apart from this lack of information, it can be noted that all six panel cohorts and the two school reform stud- ies are represented in the research outcomes. The majority of these works utilized the Scientific Use Files of either the \u201coldest\u201d starting cohort of adults (SC6) or the most diverse\u2014in terms of educational transitions\u2014starting cohort of 9th-graders"

This has contributed to the impressive levels of growth of some London RMBCs, with student numbers more than trebling since 2014 (QAA, 2014 ) and, as previously dis - cussed, is leading to several new market entrants. The extent to which increasing demand will continue \u2013 and the impacts that evolving Government policy, particularly in relation to international students, will have \u2013 remains to be seen. Whilst financial imperatives appear universally important and some campuses have evolved from legacy part - nership arrangements, a range of other drivers has encouraged universities to create London campuses.

Similarly, it is difficult to quantify the strength of institutional business links and the benefits that this has brought to London- based RMBCs. Several interviewees claimed to be outperforming their home campuses in relation to stu - dent employability, and that this may be linked to industry exposure and bespoke employment related programme features, but disaggregated public data on this metric is not available. A more intangible rationale, relating to London being a test- bed for new ideas and ways of working, was expressed by some of the RMBC Directors.

The interviews were inconclusive in ascribing causality to this pattern, with some considering that the initial London project had played a role and others unsure; it would be instructive to explore this issue in more detail to understand whether an RMBC is a viable route to an IBC, as suggested by Kleibert ( 2021 ). Visiting 10 of London's RMBCs reveals that they are diverse and distinctive in their character and culture.

Whilst legal independence and autonomy go hand- in- hand in some cases, there are examples of integrated RMBCs that are almost entirely autonomous, and of subsidiaries or joint ventures that are substantially influenced by the home institution in matters of pedagogy, portfolio and strategic direction.

There would be high numbers of students in their cohort, but they would learn in small groups. They may have started learning at the RMBC at various times in the year, and in many cases would learn in blocks of several weeks based on attending in person perhaps two or three, often consecutive, days per week. This would allow them to live in relatively affordable parts of London and the Southeast, work part time and ac - commodate other responsibilities such as caring for children.

In addition to many attending London Higher (a membership organisation for HE across the capital), a sub- group has been formed: London Centres, which focuses on issues facing RMBCs (London Higher, 2023 ). 6 | CONCLUSION This paper has explored the relatively new phenomenon of the RMBC. Reaching a working definition has made it possible to distinguish new attempts at domestic geographical diversification from legacy regional multicampus arrangements and from domestic partnerships and coalitions. The growth of RMBCs in the UK, and specifically in London, warrants particular attention. It reveals that universities see RMBCs as another option for income diversification and financial sustainability, establishing physical sites in locations that are"

From a critical theory perspective, I propose that social relations in education and other sectors are characterized by con\ufb02ict and contradictions. Indeed, critical theory af\ufb01rms that educational systems in capitalist societies are involved in the reproduction and change of class relationships and cannot be understood by simply \u2018adding up\u2019 the effects ofschooling on each individual to arrive at a sense of social impact (Bowles & Gintis, 1976). According to critical theory, in all those societies with a \u2018free\u2019 market economy a primary function of education is to reproduce the social relations of capitalist society. Since \u2018equity\u2019 issues represent one of the pillars of critical theory\u2019s concerns, this paper focuses on it as well as on the concept of \u2018equality\u2019 that is often viewed as synonymous with the concept of \u2018equity\u2019.

The basic problems of \u2018equity\u2019 theory are that it employs a one-dimensional concept of fairness and emphasizes only the fairness of distribution, ignoring the fairness ofprocedure. An alternative to \u2018equity\u2019 theory is based on two justice rules: the distributional and the procedural. Distribution rules follow certain criteria: the individual\u2019s contribution and his/her needs. Preceding the \ufb01nal distribution of reward, a cognitive map of the allocative process is constructed. Hence, fairness is judged in terms of the procedure\u2019s consistency, prevention of personal bias and its representativeness of important subgroups (Deutsch, 1975; Leventhal, 1980). \u2018Equity\u2019 principles and \u2018equity\u2019 assessment are frequently applied to the individual level and or to the group level (including within the latter some groups based on their socio-economic, racial, sexual, ethnic,"

The way in which those charges are divided signi\ufb01cantly determines who does, and who does not, have access to higher education. On the face of it, equity would seem to require that access to higher education be extended to as many as possible, and perhaps even to all.

Those who take a critical perspective consider that unequal access derives not from inef\ufb01ciencies in \u2018free\u2019 market economy development, but is the direct result of the capitalist system functioning (e.g. Carnoy, 1976a, 1995; Arriagada, 1993; Petras,The equity\u2013equality conceptual dilemma 349 1999; Espinoza, 2002), which generates both unequal class relations within societies (Bowles & Gintis, 1976; Pattnayak, 1996; Petras, 1999) and dependency relations between \u2018developing\u2019 and \u2018developed\u2019 countries (Carnoy, 1976b; Espinoza, 2002). In contrast, some scholars have approached this topic from an equilibrium or functionalist perspective, assuming that unequal access to higher education stems from differences in individuals\u2019 ability (cognitive and intellectual skills) and motivation (Gardner, 1983; Sternberg, 1985, 1988; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994) or from minor biases or inef\ufb01ciencies in educational"

As with other de\ufb01nitions, the full opportunity de\ufb01nition has two major problems. First, there is the problem of ascertaining what a student\u2019s potential is, which represents an unsolvable problem. Indeed, \u2018ability\u2019 tests do not measure ability except in so far as they measure"

        "text": "achievement, which is not the same as the ability to achieve. The second major problem is to decide how much to spend to actualize a person\u2019spotential. In practical terms, the full opportunity de\ufb01nition involves signi\ufb01cant government commitment and \ufb01nancial resources, which most of the time are scarce. Last, but not least, is the dimension labelled \u2018equity for equal achievement\u2019. If this dimension is coupled with resources, then individuals who have the same achievement level would have an equal amount of \ufb01nancial, social and or cultural resources. And if \u2018equity for equal achievement\u2019 is tied with access to quality education, then students with equal past achievements should have equal access to quality education. But if \u2018equity for equal achievement\u2019 is matched with survival (educational attainment), then the competition de\ufb01nition (Warner et al., 1944) suggests that educational resources should be apportioned on a competitive basis according to how effectively students have used the resources in the past."

Finally, if \u2018equity for equal achievement\u2019 is358 O. Espinoza coupled with outcomes, then the goal is to guarantee that students with similar academic achievements in the educational system will enjoy equal incomes and jobs of similar status. Conclusion I have argued that there is an important distinction between the concepts of \u2018equity\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019 in terms of goals and purposes, which I have termed in a new equity\u2013 equality goal-oriented model. I believe that a better understanding of these two distinct concepts and the corresponding dimensions involved in each of the two notions should help to clarify and guide future discussions of a number of issues ofpublic policy. Most of the de\ufb01nitions of \u2018equity\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019 are frequently used by many researchers, evaluators,"

As a result, it is very common to see in the literature ambiguity and confusion among those social scientists using these concepts. The equality-equity model developed in this paper suggests several new directions for analysis and research. It has provided some ideas about how \u2018equity\u2019 (i.e. \u2018equity for equal needs\u2019, \u2018equity for equal potential\u2019 and \u2018equity for equal achievement\u2019) and \u2018equality\u2019 (i.e. \u2018equality of opportunity\u2019, \u2018equality for all\u2019 and \u2018equality on averageacross social groups\u2019) could be treated and measured in future research in relation to different features of the educational process (availability of resources, access, survival, output and outcome).

However,SPM methods \ufb01nd the most frequent event patterns across a set of event sequences, while EP discovers the most frequently used event patterns within agiven sequence. There are other SPM-related tech- niques such as lag sequential analysis (LAS), t-pattern analysis and Markov models.

Additionally, PHIDIAS is a project developed by ALTRAN researchers32with the aim of developing an interactive platform tailoredfor educational process reconstruction and analy- sis. This platform will allow different education centers and institutions to load their data and pro-vide access to advanced DM and PM services. \u0081Using semantics to improve EPM. Semantic con- cepts can be layered on top of existing learnerinformation assets to provide a more conceptual"

Along these lines, Cairns et al. 32 proposed how linking labels in event logs totheir underlying semantics can bring educationalprocess discovery to the conceptual level. In this way, more accurate and compact educational processes can be mined and analyzed at differentlevels of abstraction.

The informa- tion discovered in PMs has to be, not only com- prehensible, but also useful for the end-users \u2019 decision-making. For example, instead of show- ing the overall process model obtained, it is bet- ter to abstract its representation using, forexample, the normal academic notation under- standable to end-users 8,18or in the form of a list of suggestions, recommendations, and conclu-sions about the results. 13So, in addition of the three main types of EPM, some authors,14,32 consider recommendation as another emerging type. Recommendation can be seen an extension of the enhancement type instead of a new type of EPM. Chen et"

Free EPM datasets could be very useful for testing some ad-hoc models. However, not all the current EPM datasets used in research are available to download. We believe it is essential that EPM datasets arefreely available in order for EPM research to grow much more quickly. In fact, we have only found one free speci \ufb01c EPM dataset (https:// archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Educational+Pro cess+Mining+(EPM)%3A+A+Learning+Analyti cs+Data+Set). Therefore, one of the mostimportant next steps is to promote the sharing of online data-collections that can be analyzed from multiple perspectives, with variousmethods and tools.
